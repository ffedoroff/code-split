# How metrics are counted (in TypeScript)

TypeScript support is **beta**. The complexity metrics come from the same
`rust-code-analysis` pass as Rust (a tree-sitter parse, not `syn`); this file is
the TypeScript-specific normative spec. For the shared conceptual definitions of
each metric (what `cyclomatic` / `cognitive` / Halstead / `mi` mean) see
[`../rust/metrics.md`](../rust/metrics.md); this file only states what differs
for TypeScript.

## What "correct" means (normative)

This is the **source of truth** for *what each metric counts* in TypeScript — the
definition the **Metric Accuracy** goal (`cpt-code-ranker-nfr-metric-accuracy`)
and its tests assert against (see [`../../docs/metric-correctness.md`](../../docs/metric-correctness.md)).
Three rules hold for **every** metric:

- **Counted from the parsed AST, never from text.** A keyword that appears only
  as a look-alike — inside an identifier, a comment, a string, a template
  literal, or a type annotation — **does not count**. No false positives.
- **Per-function metrics are summed over the file's functions** and **omitted at
  their no-signal value** (`omit_at`; `1` for `cyclomatic`, `0` for the rest).
- **Dynamic forms are not resolved.** A dynamic `import()` expression is a call,
  not an import statement, and is *not* analyzed — a deliberate blind spot, not a
  missed count.

## Per-language metric scope

Within the central catalog the TypeScript analyzer emits **every** metric except
one:

| metric | TypeScript |
|---|---|
| `cyclomatic` `cognitive` `exits` `args` `closures` | ✅ computed |
| LOC (`sloc` `lloc` `cloc` `blank`), Halstead, `mi` / `mi_sei` | ✅ computed |
| `tloc` | ❌ not produced — only the Rust analysis strips `#[cfg(test)]`; TS test files are counted as ordinary production lines |

This gap is an analyzer-scope limit, not a fixture or detector bug, and is pinned
per language in [`../../docs/e2e.md`](../../docs/e2e.md).

## Dependency edges

File→file edges come from `import` / `export` statements: named imports, the
**extension-less** `from "./b"` form (the resolver tries `.ts`), type-only
`import type`, and `export * from`. Alias resolution (`tsconfig` `paths` /
`baseUrl`) is honored. **Not** detected: dynamic `import()` expressions — a
runtime call with no static path to resolve, so no edge is produced.

# PRD — Code Ranker Viewer (`code-ranker-viewer`)

The offline HTML viewer: the self-contained report `code-ranker report`
generates — single-snapshot visualization, client-side node sorting, the
Prompt Generator, and the browser-side baseline↔current diff. This is a
component slice of the product PRD — for the product overview, actors,
plugin/extraction layer, graph model and JSON schema, see the main
[PRD](../PRD.md); for the CLI command surface that produces these reports see
[`code-ranker-cli/PRD.md`](../code-ranker-cli/PRD.md).

## 1. Visualization Reports — Step 2

### HTML Report Generation

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-ranker-fr-html-report`

The `code-ranker report` subcommand MUST analyze the workspace and, when the
`html` artifact is selected (the default set is both `json` and `html`),
generate a single self-contained offline HTML file alongside the snapshot
`.json`. The HTML MUST include:

- Interactive file-graph visualization, with `external` library nodes
  shown in a distinct amber colour (dashed edges)
- A coupling metrics table showing node weight (fan-in + fan-out) for
  each file
- All JavaScript and CSS inlined (no CDN or external resources)

**Rationale**: A self-contained HTML file requires no server, no
internet, and no installed dependencies to view — maximizing
accessibility for developers and reviewers on any machine.

**Actors**: `cpt-code-ranker-actor-developer`, `cpt-code-ranker-actor-tech-lead`

### Node Sorting by Weight

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-ranker-fr-node-sorting`

The HTML report MUST allow the user to sort files by coupling weight
(fan-in + fan-out edge count). The report MUST display the top-N
heaviest files prominently. Sorting MUST be performed client-side within
the HTML (no server required).

**Rationale**: The heaviest nodes are the most likely candidates for
refactoring. Surfacing them first reduces the time to actionable insight.

**Actors**: `cpt-code-ranker-actor-developer`, `cpt-code-ranker-actor-tech-lead`

### Map navigation — semantic zoom & cycle visibility

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-ranker-fr-map-zoom-cycles`

The map MUST support **semantic level-of-detail navigation ("dig")** independent
of pixel zoom: a relative level centred on the default grouping (crates, dig 0),
where the user can **dig in** (`+N`, descend into folders within crates) or **dig
out** (`-N`, progressively collapse the deepest crates into their parent folder
until a single root group remains). Stepping re-groups the whole overview;
**clicking a group** drills into just that group's files. The current level MUST
be shown and the state MUST round-trip through the URL (`dig=`).

Cycle membership MUST be **visible at every level**: file nodes and edges in a
dependency cycle are drawn red, and a collapsed group (crate/folder) is marked
when it contains cycle members. A **cycle filter** toggle (next to the size
controls) MUST be able to reduce the map to only the nodes in a cycle and the
edges between them (callers/dependencies clusters kept). Cycle data is sourced
solely from the backend (`graph.cycles`); per-language thresholds are kept in
`principles/<lang>/metric-thresholds.md`.

**Rationale**: A flat per-file map does not scale to large workspaces. Semantic
zoom lets a developer start at the crate level and drill toward the files that
matter, while cycles — the highest-priority structural smell — stay visible at
the level they are reasoning about.

### AI Prompt Generator (P2)

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-code-ranker-fr-ai-prompts`

The HTML report SHOULD include a UI control that generates a prompt for
an LLM, pre-populated with the top-N heaviest nodes and their coupling
context, asking for refactoring recommendations. The prompt format MUST
be copyable as plain text for direct paste into any LLM interface.

The **same recommendation engine is exposed on the CLI** as two `report`
output formats, so the guidance is reachable without opening the HTML
(driven from the snapshot's calibrated `node_attributes[*].thresholds`
`info` / `warning` tiers — advisory, never a gate):

- `--output.prompt[.path]` — the LLM prompt for **one** principle, the same
  Markdown the HTML Prompt Generator produces (intent, summary, principle-doc
  link, a task checklist, the ranked offending modules, and the principle's
  connection lists). Defaults to a per-principle file
  `.code-ranker/{ts}-{git-hash-3}-{preset}.md` (or `stdout`).
- `--output.scorecard[.path]` — a console **triage** overview (a per-principle
  table of `warning` / `info` counts + the worst module, then the worst modules
  overall, then a hint to the prompt for the worst principle). Defaults to
  `stdout`.

Both share three flags: `--preset <ID>` (a principle from the snapshot's
`presets`; **optional** — when omitted the principle with the most violations
is chosen), `--severity <info|warning|auto>` (the tier; repeatable for the
scorecard, single for the prompt; `auto` = warning-if-any-else-info), and
`--top <N>` (how many modules; `--top 1` = the single worst). These flags apply
only with a `prompt` / `scorecard` format; an explicit `--index` is rejected
with a hint to use `--top`.

The CLI side of this engine is documented in
[`code-ranker-cli/DESIGN.md`](../code-ranker-cli/DESIGN.md#code-ranker-cli-recommendation-engine)
(`cpt-code-ranker-component-recommend`).

**Rationale**: Connecting structural data to an LLM's reasoning closes
the loop between measurement and advice without coupling the offline
tool to a specific LLM provider. The CLI surface lets an agent or a CI
step pull the same prompt/triage non-interactively.

**Actors**: `cpt-code-ranker-actor-developer`, `cpt-code-ranker-actor-tech-lead`

### Principles-Based Prompt Generation (P3)

- [x] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-code-ranker-fr-principles-prompts`

The HTML report SHOULD support a principles-audit prompt mode that maps
the top coupling findings to the canonical principle corpus under
`principles/<language>/` (currently `rust/`, `python/`, `typescript/`)
and instructs the LLM to audit the codebase against each principle.

**Actors**: `cpt-code-ranker-actor-developer`, `cpt-code-ranker-actor-tech-lead`

## 2. Baseline Comparison — diff viewer (Step 4)

These are the `report --baseline` (human-facing HTML diff) requirements of
Step 4. The machine gate (`check --baseline`) is specified in
[`code-ranker-cli/PRD.md`](../code-ranker-cli/PRD.md) (`cpt-code-ranker-fr-compare`,
`cpt-code-ranker-fr-diff-text-report`).

### Graph Diff Engine

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-ranker-fr-graph-diff`

> **Computed browser-side from two embedded snapshots.** `report --baseline`
> embeds both the baseline (`cs-baseline`) and current (`cs-current`) snapshots
> inline; the data-driven viewer (`diff.js` `computeDiff` / `computeCycles`)
> derives node/edge added / removed / affected status and per-side cycle status
> at load. There is **no** server-side structured count summary in the JSON (the
> old `compare_snapshots` engine is gone); the relative gate
> (`cpt-code-ranker-fr-compare`) is rule-based, not count-based.

With `--baseline <snapshot>`, `code-ranker report` computes a structured
diff between the baseline snapshot and the current `[input]`: nodes and
edges added, removed, or affected. The diff includes an overall
verdict: `improved`, `degraded`, or `neutral`. The interactive
diff HTML uses Graphviz WASM (bundled in the binary) for client-side
DOT→SVG layout; there is a single Files view (no level switcher). The map
opens in **group view** — one node per group (e.g. per-crate, from
`ui.grouping.key`), with deduped inter-group edges. **Clicking a group node
drills into it**: the map re-renders showing only that group's files in
directory sub-clusters, plus two neighbor clusters — **callers** (left, green
background) listing other groups whose files call into this group, and
**dependencies** (right, orange background) listing groups this group calls
out to; clicking a neighbor group navigates into it. When digging in (folder
groups wrapped in crate clusters), clicking a folder box drills into that folder
while clicking the crate cluster around it drills into the whole crate. **Inside
a focused group**, clicking a folder (a directory sub-cluster, or a collapsed
folder box) drills into it, and a `−`/`+` control on the last breadcrumb crumb
collapses that group's files into folder boxes / expands them back — the same
level-of-detail idea as the overview's dig, scoped to the focus. A **breadcrumb
trail** (top-left of the diagram, e.g. `all crates › user-provisioning (bin) ›
domain`) shows the path; each segment is clickable and the root returns to the
group overview (counts per segment appear on hover). The drill
state is reflected in the `group=` URL parameter so browser Back / Forward /
Refresh work correctly; mode changes update the URL via `replaceState`.
The map is laid out **once** from the **union** of both snapshots; the
`[data-side]` Baseline/Current buttons are a pure CSS visibility flip. **Current
is shown by default.** The display mode is controlled by **three buttons** —
`■` (box/label mode), `SLOC` (circles sized by source lines), `HK` (circles
sized by Henry-Kafura) — reflected in the `mode=` URL parameter. In metric
modes (SLOC/HK): in group view circles are sized by the aggregate value across
the group's files (`max(baselineAgg, currentAgg)`); in drilled file view each
circle is resized to the active side's value around its fixed centre. The
active side is reflected in `side=baseline|current`, the node-table title, and
header badges. Header slots, review mode, snapshot swap, cycle annotation
(side-aware red stroke from backend `cycles`), internal blue nodes, and amber
external nodes behave as before. The node
table column order is: checkbox, Name, Kind, Cycle, Status, LOC, HK,
Fan-in, Fan-out, H.vol, H.bugs, H.effort, H.time, H.len, H.vocab,
Cyclomatic, Cognitive, MI, MI SEI, Logical, Comments, Blank. A checkbox column
(leftmost) enables persistent multi-node selection (shared across
Baseline/Current by node id — a file present in both snapshots stays selected
when toggling; the selected-row count reflects the active side): clicking a checkbox
highlights the row (yellow) and the corresponding SVG node (yellow fill
- amber stroke); shift-click selects a range; the header checkbox
selects or deselects all visible rows (indeterminate when partial).
Selection also works directly on the map: **holding Shift** turns the main
diagram into a selection surface (the cursor changes over the SVG), and
Shift-clicking an SVG node toggles its selection — exactly like ticking its
table checkbox, kept in sync — instead of opening the modal. Holding the
**"open source" modifier** — **⌘ on macOS, Ctrl elsewhere** (Ctrl is left
alone on macOS, where it maps to right-click) — likewise changes the cursor
and turns a node click into "open source": it opens the file on the project's
git host (from `git.origin`) in a new tab instead of the modal (project files
only). While either modifier is held — or the cursor hovers the right edge — the map's
right-side controls (zoom and node-size) and a bottom-left shortcut legend are
revealed; the legend spells out the active keys for the platform (⌘ on macOS,
Ctrl elsewhere).
The modal popup opened by clicking a row or an SVG node is fullscreen
(locks body scroll); it includes a synced selection checkbox, fields in
order id (⎘ copy) → path (⎘ copy, filename bold) → source (a link to the
file on the project's git host, built from `git.origin`; project files
only) → kind → visibility → items/methods → cycle info → status → metric
sections in a single column. Hover highlight (blue drop-shadow) takes CSS
priority over selection highlight. **Space** toggles the selection checkbox
while the popup is open. The popup's neighbourhood diagram stacks the
connections in **labelled blocks, 5 cards per row**: from the top — external
callers, one block per **other crate** that calls in (`crate in: <crate>`),
same-crate callers (`fan in`), the **central node**, same-crate dependencies
(`fan out`), one block per other crate it depends on (`crate out: <crate>`), and
external dependencies; per-crate blocks are ordered with the biggest nearest the
node. **Arrows are drawn only between fan-in → node → fan-out.** Cards are tinted
like the map's clusters — green for callers, yellow for dependencies — while
same-crate cards stay neutral and 3rd-party (external) cards are grey. It mirrors
the map's gestures — Shift-click toggles a node's selection, ⌘/Ctrl-click opens
its source — and shows the same yellow highlight for nodes already selected; the
external cards and arrows are inert (not selectable, no source, no
⌘-navigation). Hovering a neighbour card shows its file name, `crate:` and
`path:` (repo-relative, `/foo/bar`).

**Rationale**: The diff is the quantitative answer to "did my
refactoring reduce coupling?" Without it, the user must compare two
static visualizations manually.

### Diff HTML Report

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-ranker-fr-diff-html-report`

`code-ranker report --baseline` generates a single self-contained
offline HTML report (named `…-diff.html`) displaying:

- Added / removed / affected files and edges, color-coded by per-node diff
  state (added, removed, affected, unchanged)
- Cycle detection: files/edges in dependency cycles annotated with
  `baseline-only` / `current-only` / `both` / `none` status and red-stroke
  highlighting
- `external` library nodes shown in a distinct amber colour with dashed
  edges to distinguish them from internal file edges
- Diff summary table: node/edge counts and cycle counts (SCCs, nodes in
  cycles), baseline vs current with Δ
- All JavaScript and CSS bundled locally (no CDN or external resources)

**Rationale**: Self-contained HTML is viewable without tooling and
suitable for attaching to PRs or sharing with stakeholders.

# code-split rule reference

Every diagnostic emitted by `code-split check` is identified by a stable, dotted
**rule id** — the *same string* you use as the config key and the CLI flag — and
tagged with a concern **group** (`CYC` / `CPX` / `CPL` / `SIZ`). There are no
opaque numeric codes: the id *is* the documentation.

| Identifier | Example | Also used as |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| Rule id | `threshold.file.loc` | CLI flag `--threshold file.loc=N` · config key `rules.thresholds.file.loc` |
| Group | `SIZ` | filtering / the `ref` link into this page |

The prose below is what `check` prints in its console output, so a single finding
copied from the terminal is already a complete, self-contained prompt for an AI
assistant — it carries the rule id, the location, the measurement, the rationale,
and the fix.

## Severity model

code-split has **no severity levels**. A rule is either *active* or not:

- **Cycle rules** are on/off. `mutual` and `chain` are on by default;
  `test-embed` is off. A cycle of an active kind is a violation.
- **Threshold rules** are inactive until you set a number. Once set, any unit (or
  graph average) over the limit is a violation.

Any violation of any active rule fails `check` with a non-zero exit code. There
is no warning tier — if something should not fail the build, turn the rule off or
raise its threshold rather than downgrading it.

| Exit code | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `0` | No violations — or violations found but `--exit-zero` was passed (collect-only). |
| `1` | One or more violations, **or** an operational error (bad config, plugin failure, snapshot not found). Operational errors are reported as a plain message, not a rule id. |

`--top N` limits only how many findings are *reported* (worst-first by breach
severity); it never changes the exit code.

## Threshold scopes

A threshold rule id is `threshold.<scope>[.avg].<metric>`. The **scope** is the
kind of unit — and *is* the graph it lives on:

| Scope | Applies to |
|-------|-----------|
| `file` | a single file (files graph) |
| `module` | a single module/crate (modules graph) |
| `function` | a single function/method (functions graph) |

This lets each kind of unit carry its own budget — a 400-line *file* is fine, an
80-line *function* may not be.

**Single vs. average — every scope has both.** Without `.avg` the limit is checked
**per unit** (any single unit over the limit is a violation); with `.avg` it is
checked against that scope's **graph-wide average**:

| Form | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `threshold.<scope>.<metric>` | a single unit exceeds | `--threshold function.cognitive=25` |
| `threshold.<scope>.avg.<metric>` | the graph average exceeds | `--threshold function.avg.cognitive=8` |

So `function.loc` caps any one function while `function.avg.loc` caps the average
function size. The single and average buckets are independent — set either or both.

```bash
code-split check --threshold file.loc=400 --threshold function.loc=80 \
  --threshold function.avg.cognitive=8
```

The **metric** is one of `cyclomatic`, `cognitive`, `hk`, `fan_in`, `fan_out`,
`loc` (see the group tables below). Every scope and form of one metric shares the
same rationale and fix.

**Value syntax.** A threshold value accepts `_` digit separators and a `K` / `M` /
`G` multiplier suffix (×10³ / ×10⁶ / ×10⁹, case-insensitive): `5K` = 5 000,
`1.5M` = 1 500 000. On the CLI use it bare (`--threshold module.hk=5M`). In TOML a
suffix must be quoted (`hk = "5M"`) since bare `5M` is not valid TOML; underscored
integers are native (`hk = 5_000_000`).

> **Scope availability depends on the plugin's graphs.** A scope only fires if the
> plugin builds its graph. The **Python** and **JavaScript/TypeScript** plugins
> build files, modules, and functions — so `file`, `module`, and `function` all
> apply. The **Rust** plugin builds modules and functions but no files graph (a
> Rust file ≈ a module), so use `module` for a single Rust unit; `file` is inert
> there.

## Anatomy of a finding

In the default `human` output each violation is one block:

```text
threshold.function.cognitive  ·  CPX  ·  functions graph
  where  fn:app::handlers::process — src/handlers.rs:142
  issue  cognitive complexity 67 exceeds limit 25 (2.7× over budget)
  why    Cognitive complexity weights nested and interrupted control flow by how hard a human finds it to follow…
  fix    Extract nested blocks into named helpers, use early returns to cut nesting depth…
  tune   set with --threshold function.cognitive=N   ·   rules.thresholds.function.cognitive in code-split.toml
  ref    docs/ERRORS.md#group-cpx
```

- **rule id + group + graph** — the rule, its concern group, and which graph (modules / files / functions) it fired on.
- **where** — `id — path:line`, a clickable location. Omitted for graph-average and cycle rules.
- **issue** — the measurement: value, limit, and how far over budget.
- **why / fix** — the rationale and the concrete remedy.
- **tune** — the CLI flag and the `code-split.toml` key that adjust or disable the rule (identical to the rule id).
- **ref** — a link to this page's group section.

## Output formats

`check --output-format` controls how findings are serialized. The rule id and
group are present in every format.

| Format | Identifies the rule as | Notes |
|--------|------------------------|-------|
| `human` (default) | the block header | Rich, self-contained blocks as shown above. |
| `json` | `"rule"` + `"group"` fields | Array of `{rule, group, graph, location, message, weight}`. |
| `github` | annotation title (`code-split threshold.file.loc`) | GitHub Actions `::error` workflow commands. |
| `sarif` | `ruleId` | SARIF 2.1.0; the rules that fired are described under `tool.driver.rules` (id, group, rationale, helpUri). |

## Rule groups

<a id="group-cyc"></a>

### CYC — dependency cycles

Cycles are structural: they come from the import/dependency graph, not from a
metric threshold. `mutual` and `chain` are on by default; `test-embed` is off.
Disable a kind with `--cycle-rule KIND=off` (or `rules.cycles.KIND = false`).

| Rule id | What it flags | How to fix |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| `cycle.mutual` | Two units import each other (A ↔ B), so neither can be built, tested, or understood in isolation — the tightest possible coupling. | Move the shared types into a third, lower-level unit both depend on; invert one direction behind a trait/interface; or merge the two if they are really one concept. |
| `cycle.chain` | Three or more units form a strongly-connected component (A → B → C → A); the whole component must be loaded and changed together, defeating modular boundaries. | Find the edge that closes the loop — usually one "back" dependency pointing upward — and invert or remove it, or introduce an abstraction layer between the units. |
| `cycle.test-embed` | Production code reaches a module that exists only for tests, coupling shippable code to test scaffolding so the two cannot ship or be reasoned about separately. | Move test-only helpers into a test module/target, gate them behind a test feature, or invert the dependency so tests depend on production code and never the reverse. |

### CPX — control-flow complexity

Threshold rules: `threshold.<scope>.<metric>` for the metrics below. Use any
scope from [Threshold scopes](#threshold-scopes) — `node` / `file` / `module` /
`function` for a single unit, `avg` for the graph average. Inactive until a limit
is set.

| Metric | What it flags | How to fix |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| `cyclomatic` | Cyclomatic complexity counts the independent paths through a unit; high values mean many branches, which demand many tests and are easy to get wrong. A high average means branching is spread across the codebase. | Split the function, replace branching with polymorphism or a lookup table, and pull guard clauses to the top to flatten nesting. For an average breach, simplify the worst offenders first (`--top`). |
| `cognitive` | Cognitive complexity weights nested and interrupted control flow by how hard a human finds it to follow; a high score reads as "hard to hold in your head". | Extract nested blocks into named helpers, use early returns to cut nesting depth, and avoid mixing several control structures in one function. |

<a id="group-cpl"></a>

### CPL — coupling

Threshold rules over the dependency graph. Henry-Kafura combines size and
connectivity: `hk = loc × (fan_in × fan_out)²`. Inactive until a limit is set.

| Metric | What it flags | How to fix |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| `hk` | Henry-Kafura coupling: the unit is both highly connected and large — a change-amplifier whose edits ripple widely across the system. | Cut fan-in or fan-out: narrow the public surface, split the unit by responsibility, or route dependencies through a smaller interface. Shrinking LOC also lowers hk. |
| `fan_in` | Too many other units depend on this one, making it risky to change and a single point of failure — though some hubs (shared types) carry high fan-in legitimately. | If unintended, split the unit so each caller depends only on the slice it uses; otherwise stabilize the interface so high fan-in is safe. |
| `fan_out` | This unit depends on too many others, so it breaks when any of them change and is hard to test in isolation. | Group related dependencies behind a facade, inject collaborators instead of reaching for them, or move logic closer to the data it uses. |

<a id="group-siz"></a>

### SIZ — size

Threshold rule over source lines of code. Inactive until a limit is set.

| Metric | What it flags | How to fix |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| `loc` | The unit has more source lines than allowed; large files/functions tend to hold several responsibilities and are harder to review, test, and reuse. | Split by responsibility into smaller units, extract helpers, and separate data definitions from behavior. For an average breach, break up the largest units first (`--top`). |

## Tuning recap

```bash
# Disable a cycle kind
code-split check --cycle-rule chain=off

# Single-unit limits, per kind of unit
code-split check --threshold file.loc=400 --threshold function.cognitive=25 \
  --threshold module.hk=500000

# Per-scope graph-average limits
code-split check --threshold function.avg.cyclomatic=8 --threshold file.avg.loc=200

# Collect findings without failing the build
code-split check --threshold function.loc=120 --exit-zero
```

Equivalent `code-split.toml` (single metrics sit directly under the scope; the
`avg` sub-table holds that scope's graph-average limits):

```toml
[rules.cycles]
mutual = true
chain = false
test-embed = false

[rules.thresholds.module]
hk = 500000

[rules.thresholds.file]
loc = 400

[rules.thresholds.file.avg]
loc = 200

[rules.thresholds.function]
cognitive = 25
loc = 120

[rules.thresholds.function.avg]
cyclomatic = 8
```

See [CLI.md](CLI.md) for the full `check` flag set and [config.md](config.md) for
the complete configuration schema.

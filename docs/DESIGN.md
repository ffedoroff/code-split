## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architectural Vision

Code Split is a four-step pipeline: **extract → visualize → (user
modifies) → diff**. The platform is built around a single portable
JSON artifact format that decouples the extraction layer (plugins) from
the consumption layer (report generator, diff engine). Either layer can
evolve independently as long as the schema version is respected.

At P1 the platform ships three components:

- **Rust Plugin** (`code-split-rust`): a Cargo workspace analyzer built
  on `syn` (syntactic analysis). It builds the Rust module graph and
  collapses it to a single **file graph**; outputs a single snapshot
  `.json` file per run
- **Report Generator** (`code-split report`): built into `code-split-cli`;
  re-analyzes the workspace and writes artifacts — a snapshot `.json`
  and/or a single self-contained offline HTML viewer (optionally a diff
  view against a `--before` baseline in the same run); all JS/CSS assets
  embedded in the binary via `include_str!`
- **Diff Engine** (`code-split diff`): built into `code-split-cli`; compares
  two existing snapshot files (no analysis); produces an interactive HTML
  diff report (client-side layout, a single Files view, a Before/After
  toggle that renders each snapshot as its own clean diagram) and/or a
  machine-readable JSON diff with an `improved` / `degraded` / `neutral` verdict

The three pillars of the design are:

1. **JSON-first artifact contract** — the single snapshot file is the
   sole handoff between all components; any plugin can feed any
   consumer
2. **Offline-first** — every P1 component runs without network access;
   generated HTML reports inline all assets
3. **Pluggable extraction layer** — the built-in plugins (`rust`,
   `python`, `javascript`) all produce the same JSON artifact, so new
   languages can be added as built-in plugins without touching the
   consumer tools

### 1.2 Architecture Drivers

#### Functional Drivers

| Requirement | Design Response |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `cpt-code-split-fr-rust-plugin` | Implemented by `code-split-syn`, orchestrated in-process by `code-split-cli`'s `plugin::rust` module, which collapses the module graph to a file graph. Outputs a single snapshot `.json`. |
| `cpt-code-split-fr-lang-plugins` (Python, JS/TS) | Python: `plugin::python` using `tree-sitter-python`. JS/TS: `plugin::javascript` using `tree-sitter-javascript` / `tree-sitter-typescript`, supporting both ESM and CommonJS. Both emit `File` nodes + file→file `uses` edges + `External` library nodes, and annotate per-file complexity via `code-split-complexity`. |
| `cpt-code-split-fr-file-graph` | All plugins emit a single file graph: `File` nodes with `uses` / `reexports` edges between files, plus `External` library nodes at depth 1 reached by `uses` edges flagged `external: true`. The Rust plugin derives it by collapsing its module graph; Python/JS/TS build it directly from import resolution. |
| `cpt-code-split-fr-local-only` | `--local-only` passes `--no-deps` to `cargo metadata`; external dependencies are not enumerated. The file graph and per-file complexity are still produced. |
| `cpt-code-split-fr-html-report` | Built-in Rust renderer in `code-split-cli`: `report` re-analyzes the workspace, then renders an HTML template with inline assets alongside the JSON snapshot. |
| `cpt-code-split-fr-node-sorting` | Node weight (fan-in + fan-out) is computed at render time and embedded in the HTML; client-side JavaScript sorts the table on user interaction. |
| `cpt-code-split-fr-graph-diff` | Built-in diff in `code-split-cli`: reads two snapshot files, performs node/edge set difference on the file graph, computes weight delta per node. |
| `cpt-code-split-fr-diff-html-report` | The diff data structure is rendered into a self-contained HTML template with color-coded before/after views; all assets inlined. |
| `cpt-code-split-fr-diff-text-report` | The diff data structure is serialized to a machine-readable JSON diff (`diff --format json`) with counts, top-delta nodes, and the `improved` / `degraded` / `neutral` verdict for CI parsing. |

#### NFR Allocation

| NFR ID | Summary | Allocated To | Design Response |
|--------|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| `cpt-code-split-nfr-offline` | Zero outbound network calls | All components | Rust plugin: no HTTP; `code-split report` / `code-split diff`: HTML assets embedded in binary, no CDN references in generated output. |
| `cpt-code-split-nfr-performance` | ≤ 30 s @ 50k LOC (plugin); ≤ 5 s @ 10k nodes (report/diff) | `code-split-syn`, `code-split-complexity`, `code-split-cli` | Syntactic analysis + the module→file collapse run in seconds (no rust-analyzer); report/diff subcommands process JSON in a single pass. |
| `cpt-code-split-nfr-portability` | JSON artifacts stable within a major version | All components | Schema version field in `meta`; diff tool aborts on mismatch; additive-only changes within a major version. |

## 2. Principles & Constraints

### 2.1 Design Principles

#### JSON Artifact Contract as the Sole Integration Surface

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-principle-json-contract`

The single JSON snapshot file (one `files` graph plus metadata) is the
ONLY handoff between the plugin layer and the consumer layer. No
in-process coupling between the analysis crates and the report/diff
rendering code is permitted. This contract is versioned via
`schema_version`; the diff tool aborts on a version mismatch.

#### Offline-First

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-principle-offline-first`

Every P1 component must work without network access. Generated HTML
files must contain no external resource references. This is a design
constraint, not a preference — it must be verified in CI.

#### Files-Only Graph Model

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-principle-files-only`

The snapshot carries exactly one graph level: **files**. Node kinds in
output are `File` (a project source file, carrying all metrics) and
`External` (a third-party library, recorded at depth 1 — one node per
library, never expanded). Edge kinds are `uses` and `reexports` between
files, plus `uses` edges flagged `external: true` from a file to a
library node. There is no module, function, or call graph: language
plugins resolve everything down to file→file dependencies before the
snapshot is written.

#### Internal Coupling Excludes External Libraries

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-principle-internal-coupling`

`fan_in`, `fan_out`, and Henry-Kafura (`HK = sloc × (fan_in × fan_out)²`)
are computed from **internal** file→file edges only. Edges to `External`
library nodes are excluded from these counts and from HK, and are
surfaced separately in `coupling.fan_out_external`. Rationale: HK
measures internal architectural coupling, not the breadth of 3rd-party
library usage, which would otherwise drown out real structural signal.

#### Pluggable Extraction, Stable Consumers

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-principle-pluggable`

The report generator and diff engine are schema consumers, not
language-aware tools. Adding a new language plugin MUST NOT require
changes to any consumer tool. All language-specific knowledge lives
exclusively in the plugin.

### 2.2 Constraints

#### Stable Rust Toolchain

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-constraint-stable-rust`

The Rust plugin must build on stable Rust. `rustc_private` and
nightly-only features are prohibited.

#### Python 3.9+ Minimum

- [x] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-constraint-python`

The built-in Python language plugin targets Python 3.9+ as the minimum
version to analyze. No Python runtime is required by the `code-split`
binary itself; the constraint applies to the target workspace being
analyzed, not the execution environment.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Domain Model

**Technology**: Rust structs and enums in `code-split-core`; JSON schema
in `crates/code-split-core/schemas/graph.schema.json`.

| Entity | Description | Location |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Graph | Ordered collection of nodes and edges; serialized to JSON as the single `files` graph | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| Node | `id`, `kind`, `name`, `path?`, `external?`, `version?` (resolved semver, on Rust crate/`External` nodes), `visibility?`, `complexity?`, `cycle_kind?` | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| Edge | `from`, `to`, `kind`, `external?`, `visibility?` | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| NodeKind | Enum. Output kinds: `File` (a project source file), `External` (a 3rd-party library at depth 1). The variants `Crate`, `Module`, `Trait` are internal-only — used by `code-split-syn` while building the Rust module tree and collapsed into `File`/`External` by the Rust plugin before serialization; they never appear in a snapshot. | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| EdgeKind | Enum. Output kinds: `Uses`, `Reexports` (both between files; `Uses` to an `External` node when the edge is flagged `external`), and `Contains`. A `Contains` edge records a Rust `mod foo;` declaration (parent file → child file): it is **kept in the JSON snapshot as structural ownership metadata**, but consumers treat it as ownership rather than information flow — it is not drawn on the main map and is excluded from fan_in / HK / cycle detection. Self-edges and cross-crate `Contains` are dropped during the collapse; only cross-file parent→child `Contains` survive. | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| CycleKind | Enum: `TestEmbed` (Rust `#[cfg(test)]` back-edge), `Mutual` (SCC size 2), `Chain` (SCC size ≥ 3). Set on each node in a cycle via `cycle_kind`. | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| CycleGroup | SCC with ≥ 2 nodes: `kind: CycleKind`, `nodes: Vec<NodeId>`. Stored in `Graph.cycles`. | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| NodeId | Stable string key with no line numbers or byte offsets. Schemes: `file:{path}` for a source file, `ext:{name}` for an external library. | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs`, `crates/code-split-core/src/snapshot.rs` |
| Complexity | Nested code-metrics object on a node. Top-level scalars: `cyclomatic`, `cognitive`, `exits`, `args`, `functions`, `closures` (zero-valued fields omitted). Sub-objects: `coupling?` (`fan_in`, `fan_out`, `fan_out_external`, `hk` — omitted when all fan values are 0), `maintainability?` (`mi`, `mi_sei`), `loc?` (`source`, `logical`, `comments`, `blank`), `halstead?` (`length`, `vocabulary`, `volume`, `effort`, `time`, `bugs`). Entire `complexity` object omitted when all sub-fields are zero/absent. Present on `File` nodes; absent on `External` nodes. All numeric fields use 3-significant-digit truncation; whole numbers serialized without decimal point. | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| Coupling | `fan_in`, `fan_out` (internal file→file counts), `fan_out_external` (distinct external libraries depended on), `hk` (Henry-Kafura from internal counts only). | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| AvgCoupling | Average coupling stored inside `GraphStats`: `fan_in`, `fan_out`, `hk` (all f64, zero-valued fields omitted). | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| GraphStats | Optional summary attached to the `files` graph after all annotations. Mirrors the `Complexity` node structure with averages: top-level `cyclomatic`, `cognitive`; sub-objects `coupling?` (`AvgCoupling`), `maintainability?`, `loc?`, `halstead?`. Zero-valued scalar fields and absent sub-objects are omitted. Percentiles are not stored — the viewer computes them client-side from raw node data. Populated by `annotate_stats()` in `code-split-core`. | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs`, `crates/code-split-core/src/stats.rs` |
| Snapshot | A single `.json` file combining `workspace` (cwd), `target` (analyzed project), `plugin`, `config_file?` (path of loaded config file, omitted when none), `roots` (named path prefixes; pruned to only those actually used to shorten a node path, so e.g. a JS/TS/Python snapshot carries no Rust toolchain roots), `versions`, `git`, `timings`, and a `graphs` object with a single key: `files`. Serialized via `to_canonical_string_pretty` — **canonical JSON**: every object key alphabetical, `nodes`/`edges` arrays sorted by stable key — so unchanged code re-serializes byte-for-byte (no `HashMap`-order churn). | `crates/code-split-core/src/snapshot.rs` |
| StageTime | Per-stage timing entry: `stage` (name), `ms` (elapsed milliseconds), `detail` (human summary). Stored in `Snapshot.timings` in execution order. | `crates/code-split-core/src/snapshot.rs` |
| GraphDiff | Computed from two `Snapshot`s: per-level sets of added/removed nodes and edges, weight-delta per node, coupling direction verdict | `crates/code-split-cli/src/main.rs` |

**Relationships**:

- `Node` → `Node`: linked via `Edge`.
- `Graph` → `Node`/`Edge`: ownership; nodes carry an optional `parent`
  pointing to the containing node.
- `GraphDiff` is computed from two `Snapshot`s and owns no graph data —
  it references node IDs only.

### 3.2 Component Model

#### code-split-core

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-component-core`

Provides the shared vocabulary: graph types, kind enums, the
`GraphBuilder` API, and the JSON serialization logic. Has zero I/O.
Depends on `petgraph` and `serde` only; no `cargo_metadata` or `syn`.

Modules beyond graph types:

- **`cycles.rs`** — `annotate_all_cycles`: Kosaraju SCC on the file
  graph over `Uses`/`Reexports` edges only (`Contains` is excluded — a
  `mod foo;` declaration plus the child importing the parent's types is a
  Rust idiom, not an architectural cycle). Classifies each SCC as
  `TestEmbed` (a test-named file in the SCC) / `Mutual` / `Chain`, sets
  `node.cycle_kind` and writes `graph.cycles: Vec<CycleGroup>`.
- **`hk.rs`** — `annotate_hk`: computes Henry-Kafura complexity
  (`hk = sloc × (fan_in × fan_out)²`) for every file node and writes the
  result into `node.complexity.coupling`
  (`Coupling { fan_in, fan_out, fan_out_external, hk }`). `fan_in` /
  `fan_out` count **internal** file→file `uses`/`reexports` edges only;
  edges flagged `external` are excluded and counted into
  `fan_out_external` instead, so HK reflects internal coupling rather
  than 3rd-party library breadth. The `loc` factor is the same one shown
  in `complexity.loc` (`loc.source`). With no loc or no internal
  in/out coupling, `hk` is 0.
- **`diff.rs`** — `compare_snapshots(before, after) -> CompareSummary`:
  mirrors `computeDiff()` from `diff.js`; computes added/removed/affected/
  unchanged counts for nodes and edges in the file graph, then propagates
  `affected` to unchanged nodes adjacent to changed edges. Used by
  `code-split diff --format json`.
- **`snapshot.rs`** — snapshot types plus path relativization
  (`relativize_graphs` / `rewrite_ids`, mapping absolute paths to
  `{target}` / `{cargo}` / … tokens) and **canonical serialization**
  (`to_canonical_string` / `to_canonical_string_pretty`): round-trips
  through `serde_json::Value` (a `BTreeMap`, so keys come out alphabetical)
  and sorts the `nodes`/`edges` arrays by a stable key. This guarantees a
  deterministic, byte-stable snapshot for unchanged input.

#### code-split-syn

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-component-syn`

Produces the Rust module graph via syntactic analysis. Calls
`cargo metadata`; classifies crates as local vs. external; walks local
source trees with `syn` to extract the module hierarchy and `use` /
`pub use` statements, emitting `Crate` / `Module` / `Trait` nodes and
`Contains` / `Uses` / `Reexports` edges. It also runs a `syn::visit`
path collector over each file to capture **bare qualified paths** in
expressions/types (≥ 2 segments, no `use`), resolved through the same
full resolver as `use` statements: this captures both cross-crate
(`other_crate::item` → the extern crate) and intra-crate paths
(`commands::run()` → the local `commands` module, `crate::a::Alpha` →
its module), while `std`/`core`/keyword-only paths are ignored. External
crates are added as `Crate` nodes with
`external = true`; their source is never read. A `visited_files`
`HashSet<PathBuf>` guard in `process_package` prevents double-walking
source files when a workspace has both `lib` and `bin` targets declaring
the same modules.

These module-level nodes are **internal**: the Rust plugin's collapse
pass (see §3.7) folds them down to `File` / `External` nodes before the
snapshot is written.

**Edge sources & remaining blind spots**: file→file / file→library edges
come from two sources — (1) `use` / `pub use` statements; (2) bare
qualified paths in expressions/types (`commands::run()`, `other_crate::item`,
`crate::a::Alpha`), captured by the path visitor and resolved the same way
as `use`. A `mod foo;` declaration emits a `Contains` edge that is kept in
the JSON but treated as structural ownership only — not drawn, not counted
in fan_in / HK / cycles. What remains uncaptured: a bare reference whose
target is a re-export reached through the crate root resolves to the
**crate-root file** (e.g. `crate::Edge` → `lib.rs`) rather than the module
that defines it, and any `use` hidden inside a macro body (macros are never
expanded). A file reached only via `Contains` (e.g. a module declared with
`mod foo;` but never referenced by path or `use`) has `fan_in` 0 and can
appear isolated on the map.

#### code-split-complexity

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-component-complexity`

Annotates `File` nodes (Rust file-backed module nodes before collapse,
and the `File` nodes of the Python/JS/TS plugins) in the `GraphBuilder`
with per-file code complexity metrics. Uses `rust-code-analysis`
(Mozilla, via the `ffedoroff/rust-code-analysis` fork on branch
`patch/update-tree-sitter-0.26.8`) which is built on tree-sitter and
supports Rust, C++, JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, Kotlin, and more.
Metrics are aggregated to the whole file (the root `FuncSpace` of each
parsed file).

**Interface**:
- `code_split_complexity::analyze(workspace, builder)` — Rust (`.rs` files)
- `code_split_complexity::analyze_python(workspace, builder)` — Python (`.py`)
- `code_split_complexity::analyze_js(workspace, builder)` — JS/TS (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`)

All three delegate to a shared `analyze_extensions` implementation.

**Matching strategy**: each file's metrics come from the top-level
`FuncSpace` (`SpaceKind::Unit`) of the parsed file, matched to the graph
node by canonical path via a `HashMap<canonical_path → node_idx>`. For
Rust this is applied to the file-backed `Module` nodes (before the
plugin collapses them to `File` nodes); for Python/JS/TS it is applied
to `File` nodes directly. The map is populated with `entry().or_insert(i)`
(not `insert`) so the first node for a path wins if two nodes share it.

**Metrics computed per file**:

| Category | Fields (in `complexity` object) |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| Scalars | `cyclomatic`, `cognitive`, `exits`, `args`, `functions`, `closures` |
| Coupling | `coupling.fan_in`, `coupling.fan_out`, `coupling.fan_out_external`, `coupling.hk` (added later by `annotate_hk`, not by this crate) |
| Maintainability | `maintainability.mi`, `maintainability.mi_sei` |
| Lines of Code | `loc.source`, `loc.logical`, `loc.comments`, `loc.blank` |
| Halstead | `halstead.length`, `halstead.vocabulary`, `halstead.volume`, `halstead.effort`, `halstead.time`, `halstead.bugs` |

Each language entry point is called by its plugin after graph
construction. Metrics are whole-file aggregates, so all functions,
methods, arrow functions, and closures in a file roll up into that
file's single node — there is no per-function granularity to miss.

#### plugin::python (built-in)

- [x] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-component-python-plugin`

In-process Python plugin implemented in `code-split-cli/src/plugin/python.rs`.
Uses `tree-sitter-python` (already a transitive dep via `rust-code-analysis`)
for AST traversal and `walkdir` for file discovery.

**Pipeline**:

1. **Scan** — walk all `.py` files under the workspace, skipping `.venv`,
   `__pycache__`, `node_modules`, and any dot-prefixed directory.
2. **Module index** — derive dotted module paths from file paths:
   `parser/shops/amazon/pdp.py` → `parser.shops.amazon.pdp`;
   `parser/shops/amazon/__init__.py` → `parser.shops.amazon`.
3. **Per-file node** — emit one `File` node per `.py` file.
4. **Import resolution** — resolve `import_statement` and
   `import_from_statement` nodes. Imports that resolve to a project file
   emit a file→file `uses` edge (including `__init__.py` package imports,
   which point at the package's `__init__.py` file); relative imports
   (`.`, `..`, `.submodule`) are resolved against the current module's
   package path. Imports that do not resolve to a project file produce an
   `External` library node (`ext:<top-level-package>`, one per top-level
   package such as `numpy`) reached by a `uses` edge flagged
   `external: true`.

**ID scheme**:
- File: `file:/abs/path/to/file.py` (relativized to `{target}/...` by
  `snapshot::relativize_graphs`)
- External library: `ext:numpy`

**Visibility heuristic**: `__name` (no trailing dunder) → `Private`;
`_name` → `Restricted { path: "module" }`; otherwise → `Public`.

**Complexity**: per-file metrics annotated via
`code_split_complexity::analyze_python` (whole-file aggregate; see §3.2
`code-split-complexity`).

#### plugin::javascript (built-in)

- [x] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-component-js-plugin`

In-process JavaScript / TypeScript plugin implemented in
`code-split-cli/src/plugin/javascript.rs`. Uses `tree-sitter-javascript` and
`tree-sitter-typescript` for AST traversal and `walkdir` for file discovery.

**Source root detection**: if `src/` exists in the workspace, scans from
`src/`; otherwise scans from the workspace root. This avoids picking up
non-source `.js` files (config, scripts, test fixtures) in projects that
follow the `src/` layout convention.

**Pipeline**:

1. **Scan** — walk `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx` files from source root,
   skipping `node_modules`, `dist`, `.venv`, dotfile directories,
   `.gen.ts`, `.config.ts/js`.
2. **File index** — map each file's relative path to its absolute path.
3. **Per-file node** — emit one `File` node per source file.
4. **Import resolution** — resolve ES `import` statements and CommonJS
   `require()` calls. Imports that resolve to a project file emit a
   file→file `uses` edge; handles the `@/` path alias (→ source root),
   relative paths, and index-file collapsing (extensions tried in order:
   `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `index.ts`, `index.tsx`, `index.js`,
   `index.jsx`). Imports that do not resolve to a project file produce an
   `External` library node (`ext:<package>`, one per top-level package —
   `react`, `@scope/pkg`) reached by a `uses` edge flagged
   `external: true`.

**ID scheme** (using `src` as the source root prefix):
- File: `file:/abs/path/to/file.ts` (relativized to `{target}/...`)
- External library: `ext:react`, `ext:@scope/pkg`

**Visibility heuristic**: `_name` → `Private`; otherwise → `Public`.

**Complexity**: per-file metrics annotated via
`code_split_complexity::analyze_js` (whole-file aggregate, covering all
functions, arrow functions, and methods in the file; see §3.2
`code-split-complexity`).

#### code-split-cli

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-component-cli`

The single user-facing binary `code-split`. There is no default command —
a bare invocation prints help. `main()` owns three subcommands:

The shared analysis core (used by both `check` and `report`) loads layered
config (`config.rs` — code-split.toml / Cargo.toml metadata / CLI flags);
resolves the plugin name (CLI `--plugin` → config `plugin` → marker
auto-detect, all under `auto`); invokes the selected built-in plugin
(`rust` / `python` / `javascript`) in-process. After the plugin run it calls
`relativize_graphs` + `rewrite_ids` from `code-split-core`, then applies
config filters: `config::apply_ignore` (path globs + `tests` /
`test_modules` test-file stripping + `dev_only_crates` via
`cargo metadata`), `annotate_all_cycles` + `config::apply_cycle_rules`,
`annotate_hk` + `annotate_stats`.

- **`check`** (the linter): runs the shared analysis core, then
  `config::check_violations` over cycle checks (`--cycle-rule <KIND=on|off|N>`,
  parsed into `config::CycleRule` = `Off` | `Max(n)`; a kind's cycles are reported
  only when their per-graph count exceeds its budget, so `Max(0)` is strict and
  `Max(7)` forbids the 8th) and metric thresholds (`--threshold
  <file.METRIC=N>`). No severity tiers. There is a single threshold
  scope — `file` (the files graph) — metrics written directly under
  `[rules.thresholds.file]`. `check_node_metrics` runs the per-file
  thresholds on every file node — emitting `threshold.file.<metric>`.
  Threshold values accept `_`
  separators and `K`/`M`/`G` suffixes via `config::parse_number` (CLI flags and a
  `deserialize_with` adaptor on `MetricThresholds` for quoted TOML strings); an
  invalid configuration is a hard error, never a silent fallback to defaults. Every `Violation` is identified
  by its dotted rule id (the config key / CLI flag, e.g. `threshold.file.loc`) and
  tagged with a concern group from the `config::RULES` catalog
  (`CYC`/`CPX`/`CPL`/`SIZ`; one entry per metric resolved by `rule_doc` — the
  trailing metric segment — with `rule_tuning` deriving the flag/config knob,
  documented in [ERRORS.md](ERRORS.md)). Prints diagnostics in the selected `--output-format`
  (`human` / `json` / `github` / `sarif`): `human` (`print_human_diagnostics`)
  renders each finding as a self-contained block (rule id, group, `where` = `id —
  path`, `issue`, `why`, `fix`, `tune`, `ref`) so it doubles as an AI prompt;
  the `ref` link and the `sarif` `helpUri` are absolute GitHub URLs (`DOCS_URL` →
  `…/blob/main/docs/ERRORS.md#group-<g>`) so they're clickable from anywhere.
  `sarif` describes the fired rules under `tool.driver.rules`. With
  `--suggest-config`, `human` output then calls `print_current_values` — the
  current per-kind cycle counts and the per-file metric maxima
  as paste-ready `code-split.toml` blocks for baselining (off by default;
  machine formats omit it). Honours `--top <N>` (report only the N worst) and exits
  non-zero on any violation; `--exit-zero` suppresses the non-zero exit. Writes no
  files.
- **`report`**: runs the shared analysis core (re-analyzing the workspace),
  then writes artifacts into `--report-path` (default `.code-split`) per
  `--format` (`json`, `html`; default both). The JSON snapshot records
  `config_file` when a config was found; default name `{ts}-{git-hash-3}.json`.
  Names are templates (`render_name`) with placeholders `{project-dir}`,
  `{ts}`, `{git-hash}` (12-char short commit) and `{git-hash-N}` (first N
  chars), resolved as **`--json-name` flag › `[output] json-name` config ›
  built-in default**. The HTML viewer template and all assets
  (CSS, JS) are embedded in the binary via `include_str!` from
  `crates/code-split-cli/src/assets/`, and the snapshot data is embedded
  inline in the same file as `cs-before` / `cs-after` JSON `<script>` tags;
  default name `{ts}-{git-hash-3}.html` (`--html-name` / `[output] html-name`).
  With
  `--before <snapshot>` the HTML becomes a diff view (after = this run, before
  = the file) plus a verdict, named `{ts}-{git-hash-3}-diff.html` (`-diff`
  inserted before `.html`). `--before` accepts a `.json` snapshot or a prior
  `.html` report (the embedded snapshot is extracted via `load_snapshot_any`).
- **`diff`**: reads two **existing** snapshot files (`--before` / `--after`,
  no analysis), computes a structured diff via
  `code_split_core::compare_snapshots()`, and emits per `--format`
  (default `html`):
  - JSON diff (`--format json`, default name `diff.json`): `{ identical,
    before, after, files }` — the `files` graph has
    `{ nodes: { added, removed, affected, unchanged }, edges: { … },
    cycle_nodes_before, cycle_nodes_after, sccs_before, sccs_after }`, plus
    the `improved` / `degraded` / `neutral` verdict.
  - Interactive HTML viewer (`--format html`): all JS/CSS assets
    (`graphviz.umd.js`, `snarkdown.umd.js`, `diff.js`, `layout.js`, etc.) are
    embedded via `include_str!` constants (`ASSET_GV`, `ASSET_SNARKDOWN`,
    `ASSET_DIFF`, …); the snapshots
    are also embedded **inline** as `<script type="application/json">` tags
    (`cs-before` / `cs-after`), which the viewer reads on load. The single
    `.html` file is fully self-contained — no relative-path references, no
    `fetch`, so it opens straight from `file://`.

**Responsibility boundary**: holds no domain logic; no analysis, no
rendering, no rules. Its sole job is argument parsing, plugin
dispatch, and artifact I/O routing.

#### HTML assets (`crates/code-split-cli/src/assets/`)

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-component-html-assets`

Static assets for the `code-split report` and `code-split diff` HTML output,
embedded into the `code-split` binary via `include_str!`. Files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.html` | Shell template with a single Files view section and the diff/review summary table. Header: `.header-brand` ("CODE SPLIT"), `#title` (`<target> — diff/review`), before/after metadata, and the `↑ change` / `↑ compare…` snapshot-swap buttons (`#btn-remove-after`). Nav: `[data-side]` Before/After buttons (diff mode only — hidden in review) and `#nav-prompt-btn` ("Prompt Generator AI", always visible) with a plain warning-count (`#nav-warn-count`) after the "AI" label — the number of distinct warning **types** (metrics with ≥1 file over their `warning` threshold, plus `cycle` as one binary type when any file is in a dependency cycle; `window.warningTypeCount`), no highlight, hidden when zero. There is one graph level, so no level switcher. No control panel / status chips / review buttons — the UI is simplified so Before/After each render a clean single-snapshot diagram. |
| `index.css` | Layout, nav, SVG styling; cross-highlight: `.row-hl` (solid blue bg) and `g.node.node-hl` (blue drop-shadow) for hover; `.row-selected` (solid amber bg `rgb(254,245,222)`) and `g.node.node-selected > polygon/ellipse` (yellow fill + amber stroke) for persistent selection — hover rules last so they win; a node that is both selected **and** in a cycle keeps its **red** cycle stroke (a higher-specificity `.node-selected:is(.cycle-status-…)` rule, mirrored in the popup by `.diag-cycle.diag-selected`) — the cycle outline always wins, the yellow fill still marks it selected; `body.shift-select` changes the cursor over the map (crosshair on `.svg-frame`, `copy` on `g.node`) to signal Shift-to-select, and `body.ctrl-link` changes it (`alias` on `g.node`) to signal open-source-on-modifier-click (⌘ on macOS, Ctrl elsewhere); while either modifier class is on `body` it also sets `user-select: none` (so a Shift/⌘-click on a card never drag-selects label text) and reveals the popup's own `#node-modal-hints` legend; on the map, the modifier class (or the right-edge hover that sets `.show-zoom`) reveals the right-side `.zoom-controls` / `.size-controls` **and** the bottom-left `.kbd-hints` shortcut legend, as a cue the modes exist/are active (the legend's key labels are filled per-platform in JS — ⌘ vs Ctrl); the map uses a GitHub-style drag-to-pan cursor — `grab` (open hand) on `.svg-frame svg` at rest, `grabbing` (closed hand) under `.svg-frame.panning` while dragging (winning over a node's `pointer`); the same modifier cursors apply inside the popup diagram (`#node-modal-diagram g[data-diag-node]:not(.diag-ext)` → `copy`/`alias`; `.diag-ext` → `not-allowed`), and `#node-modal-diagram … .diag-selected > rect` gives popup cards the main-map selection highlight; `.nm-src` styles the modal's git-host "Source" link; `body.mode-review` hides `#meta-arrow` and after-group metadata; `#node-modal` fills 100% width/height (fullscreen); `body.overflow:hidden` set on open, cleared on close. The popup main card uses `.mn-card` (`copy` cursor); on `.copied` the card body (`.mn-card-body`) is hidden and a centred `.mn-copied-msg` ("copied") is shown for ~1s. (Legacy chip / `hide-*` / `show-cycle-*` visibility rules remain in the file but are unused after the UI simplification.) |
| `graphviz.umd.js` | Graphviz compiled to WASM via `@hpcc-js/wasm` (~802 KB, self-contained, no network required); renders DOT→SVG in-browser |
| `snarkdown.umd.js` | Tiny (~2 KB) Markdown→HTML renderer (`window.snarkdown`), vendored so it works offline; used by `export-popup.js` to render the generated prompt as a styled preview |
| `diff.js` | Browser-side diff computation: `computeDiff()` (node/edge status), `computeCycles()` via `buildSCCOf()` helper — prefers backend `graph.cycles` array when present (accurate `CycleKind` classification); falls back to Tarjan SCC on edges when absent; marks nodes/edges as `before-only`/`after-only`/`both`/`none`; `computeMeta()` |
| `layout.js` | `buildDOT()` — for the single file graph: internal `file` nodes are blue (`fillcolor="#dbe9f4" color="#4d6f9c"`) and clustered by directory; `external` library nodes (when present) are amber with dashed amber edges. `contains` edges are **skipped** (kept in the JSON as structural ownership, but never drawn on the main map). **At most one edge is emitted per `(from, to)` pair** — a file that both `use`s and `pub use`-reexports the same target draws a single arrow. Cycle-status class still added for CSS red-stroke overlay; `class="node-<kind> status-<status> cycle-status-<cs>"` on every node/edge. In `loc`/`hk` size mode nodes become circles scaled by the metric and labelled with it abbreviated to a **whole number** (`fmtShort` — no decimals, e.g. 1.6M → 2M) |
| `modal.js` | `getModal()` returns (or lazily creates) the `#node-modal` overlay; `closeModal()` / `closeModalSilent()` hide it and restore `body.overflow`; fixed-position tooltip on `.nm-has-hint`; delegated click handlers for `.nm-copy-btn` (textContent ✓ feedback) and `.mn-card` (copies `data-copy`, adds a CSS `copied` class for ~1s — no textContent swap, since it is an SVG group). While the modal is open a `keydown` listener handles **Esc** (close) and **Space** (toggle `#node-modal-cb`, the selection checkbox — `preventDefault` avoids page-scroll and a double-toggle). The `#node-modal-diagram` click handler mirrors the main map's modifier gestures (`window.isOpenSrcClick` / `shiftKey`): **⌘/Ctrl-click** opens a side node's source (`window.nodeSourceUrl`), **Shift-click** toggles its selection (`window.toggleNodeSelected` + live `diag-selected`); a plain click navigates (`openModalForNode`). 3rd-party (`diag-ext`) cards are inert under either modifier (no select, no source, no ⌘-navigate). The central `.mn-card` reacts to modifiers too: ⌘/Ctrl-click views its source, Shift-click toggles its selection (routed through `#node-modal-cb` for full sync) — a *plain* click still copies its path; external main cards (`diag-ext`) are inert. Every diagram render goes through `setModalDiagram(html)`, which sets the SVG and re-attaches a `#node-modal-hints` legend (same `window.kbdHintsHtml`) **inside** `#node-modal-diagram`, so the legend sits bottom-left of the SVG area (not the page) and shows while a modifier is held. |
| `export-popup.js` | `openExportPopup()` — "Prompt Generator" popup. Top row: a checkbox group (Paths / connections common / in / out — each **disabled + unchecked when it would contribute nothing** for the active node set, recomputed on every change) and a source selector: `<N> Selected` (real selected-row count) **OR** an editable count + a **sort-metric dropdown** (`sorted by` HK / SLOC / fan-out / cyclomatic / cognitive / item count / in-a-cycle). The recommended set is the **top-N nodes sorted** by the chosen metric (`recoFor` sorts the full pool worst-first — it is a *sort*, not a `> threshold` filter, so raising the count keeps adding the next rows). Two-tier thresholds per metric (`METRIC_TH_BY_LANG`, tiers **`info`** / **`warning`**) drive only the **colour**: the count is red while ≤ the `warning` count, yellow up to the `info` count, normal beyond. The thresholds are **empirically calibrated and language-specific** (each language has its own block; unknown languages fall back to `rust`), so that ~50 % of projects breach `info` and ~10 % breach `warning`. Rust (calibrated on 21 crates ≥2K SLOC): `hk` 150 000/10 000 000, `sloc` 800/3 000, `fan_out` 8/18, `item_count` 20/50; `cyclomatic` and `cognitive` are **not tracked for Rust** (file-level cyclomatic ≈1 and cognitive absent in the corpus). **These numbers are kept in sync with `principles/<lang>/metric-thresholds.md`** (the human-readable derivation; must be updated in the same commit as a threshold change). Default count is **1**; with nothing selected the `Selected` radio + `OR` are hidden and the source defaults to Recommended. Clicking a preset points the dropdown at the preset's metric (`PRESET_METRIC`; cycle presets use cycle membership) and sets the count to its headline recommendation (strict count if any, else neutral). Preset buttons (equal-width grid, ~2 rows): `CPX` (reduce complexity) plus the SOLID/principle set (ADP, SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP, DRY, KISS, LoD, MISU, CoI, YAGNI), labelled by bare code with a count badge on the right — a **low-sensitivity** display: the `warning`-level count as a calm pill in the **text colour** (`.exp-preset-count--warn`, not red), else the `info`-level count as a **plain number** (`.exp-preset-count--info` — no pill, no highlight), else empty (no zero). The button itself gets **no border/colour emphasis** for either tier — only the badge differs. The Recommended count field mirrors this: warning → `.exp-rec-warn` (text-colour tint), info → left plain. Each preset stores a language-neutral `title\n\nsummary` in `PROMPTS`; `composePrompt(key)` wraps it into a **Markdown** instruction the AI receives — `# <title>`, `## Summary`, `**Full principle:** [<url>](<url>)` (the link text is the full URL so it is never hidden behind a short code; `principles/<lang>/<slug>.md` via `PRINCIPLE_DOCS`/`principleUrl`; `lang` from the snapshot's `plugin`, JS→`typescript`), then a `## Task` checklist (download & read the principle, report violations in the modules below, save the report to `.code-split/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<CODE>.md`). Each preset auto-selects relevant connection checkboxes via `PRESET_CHECKS` (node **paths are always included**). Output (Markdown) = composed prompt + a `## Modules` list + `## Connections — common/in/out` edge lists per active checkboxes. In Recommended mode the path list is titled `## Modules ordered by <metric>`, each line `` - `src/a.rs` (HK: 19300) `` annotated with the node's value, preceded by a one-line explanation of that metric and its `**Formula:**` (`metricHeader` → `METRIC_DESCS`/`METRIC_FORMULAS`); connection lines render endpoints as paths, not ids. The raw Markdown lives in a hidden `<textarea id="export-textarea">` (the Copy source); the user sees it rendered to HTML by **snarkdown** in `#export-preview` — a white document card on the popup's soft-grey background, styled by `.exp-md-preview` (headings, lists, links, `` `code` ``). Fixed-size `Copy markdown ⎘` button overlaid bottom-right. **State persists in the URL**: `epWriteUrlState` mirrors the full popup state into the query string (`ep` = level/open, `eppreset`, `epsrc`, `epn`, `epsort`, `epconn`, repeated `epsel` per selected id) on every change; `epClearUrl` strips it on close; on load `app.js` reads `epReadUrl()`, restores the selection before the tables render, and re-opens the popup via `openExportPopup(level, restore)` — so a refresh restores the popup exactly. Popup is created once and re-used across opens. |
| `panzoom.js` | `setupPanZoom()` — viewBox-based drag-to-pan; +/−/fit/fullscreen buttons bottom-right (visible when mouse in right 15% of frame); size-mode buttons (■/LOC/HK) top-right re-render the active view; dblclick on SVG background zooms 2× at cursor; stores the fit-all viewBox on `frame.dataset.naturalVB` so `renderView` can preserve pan/zoom across re-renders; fullscreen overlay (`fs-bar`) hosts the live `<nav>` (the control panel was removed) |
| `ui.js` | Intentionally empty — before/after is now two separate clean diagrams (one graphviz layout per snapshot), so there is no chip-based filtering of a merged layout. Kept as a file because the report inlines its assets by name. |
| `app.js` | `DOMContentLoaded` handler. `window.viewSide` (`'before'`/`'after'`) selects which snapshot the diagram / node table / modal show; `activeLocalGraph()` returns that snapshot's file graph with external (3rd-party) nodes and their edges dropped from the main diagram entirely (externals appear only in the per-node modal, drawn in amber). `setViewSide()` (the Before/After buttons) re-renders the active view; `renderView()` updates the nav warning count (`#nav-warn-count` ← `window.warningTypeCount(level)`, distinct warning types) and runs `drawSVG` (which, above `SVG_NODE_LIMIT` = 500 nodes, shows a `too many nodes: N` placeholder with a *Render diagram* confirmation button instead of laying out a slow large graph — confirmed once per frame via `frame.dataset.bigConfirmed`), re-applies the node-table selection, and — across Before/After **and** size-mode re-renders — preserves pan/zoom by carrying the *relative* zoom + fractional centre vs `frame.dataset.naturalVB` (so differing layout extents don't drift the framing). `updateHeader()` switches review/diff mode and shows/hides the Before/After buttons; `buildSummary()` is mode-aware. Reads inline `cs-before` / `cs-after` JSON via `readEmbeddedSnapshot`; `setupFileControls()` / `recomputeAll()` swap a `.json` snapshot or prior `.html` report from disk; `#nav-prompt-btn` → `openExportPopup()`. On load it also reads `epReadUrl()` and, if the Prompt Generator was open, restores its selected nodes (into `window._ntSelected`) **before** the tables render, then re-opens it via `openExportPopup(level, restore)`. |
| `diagram.js` | `buildDiagramSVG(node)` — inline SVG popup diagram for a selected node. Edges are read from the raw snapshot (`window.AFTER ?? window.BEFORE`) so external library nodes (filtered from `window.DIFF`) are still visible. Connections are **deduped by node** (`collectConns`) into just two columns per direction — an unlabelled internal-`connections` column and a separate grey `external` column — both on the **same tier** (side by side). Each card records the *set* of edge kinds linking it to the main node. A node is shown only if it has an information-flow edge (`uses`/`reexports`); a `contains`-only structural link stays hidden. One arrow per column: the internal arrow is labelled `Fan-in: N` / `Fan-out: N` (distinct connected nodes); the external arrow is grey with no label (external edges count as `fan_out_external`, not `fan_in`/`fan_out`). **Side card layout**: a centred title (always visible). The card has two CSS-toggled states (`g[data-diag-node]:hover` in `index.css`): by default (`.sn-simple`) it shows only the bare `hk` (left, abbreviated, e.g. `189K`/`1.5M`; **nothing** when hk is absent — no `—`) and `loc` (right); on hover (`.sn-detail`) those become labelled `value:key` (`189K:hk` / `loc:210`, and `0:hk` when hk is absent), a bottom row of three connection-kind slots (`uses` · `reexport` · `contains`) appears (split exactly into thirds; absent kinds leave their third empty), and a `pr` chip (private nodes) is revealed top-right. **Tooltips** are the styled `#tt` ones shared with the node table (`renderDescTooltip` — title + bold formula line + description), so a metric's tooltip is byte-identical everywhere: each hk/loc label carries `data-tip`/`data-tip-formula` keyed to the same `COL_TIPS`/`COL_FORMULAS` (the whole `value:key` string is one hover target), each connection-kind label its own description, the title shows the node `path`, and the `pr` chip explains private visibility. Metric tooltips additionally carry `data-tip-calc` — the formula filled with this node's real numbers (`metricCalc`), rendered as a third line so the value's derivation is visible. This is set wherever the inputs are stored and the formula faithfully reproduces the displayed value: `hk` (`sloc × (fan_in × fan_out)²`), Halstead `volume` (`length × log₂(vocabulary)`), `bugs` (`effort^⅔ ÷ 3000` — the engine's actual definition, not the classic `volume ÷ 3000`) and `time` (`effort ÷ 18`). It is deliberately omitted where the computation would not match the displayed value: `mi`/`mi_sei` (the engine feeds MI a different cyclomatic aggregation than the per-file `cyclomatic` we store, so it wouldn't reconcile), `cyclomatic`/`cognitive`, and Halstead `length`/`vocabulary`/`effort` (no stored sub-terms — N₁/N₂, η₁/η₂, difficulty). The matching node-table value cells show the identical computation, but **lazily**: the cells carry no precomputed tooltip attributes — `setupTooltip` derives the description / formula / computation on hover (from the row's node), so nothing is built for cells the user never points at. Every tooltip's title is the metric's **full name** (`COL_NAMES`, e.g. "Halstead volume" — never the abbreviated column label or the cell value), via `data-tip-title` or the element's column id. Arrow labels read `Fan-in: N` / `Fan-out: N`. The hovered label is highlighted (`.sn-hint:hover`). No native `<title>` tooltips on the cards (they conflicted with `#tt`). External (3rd-party) cards and their arrows are **grey** (`#ececec` fill / `#9aa0a6` stroke), tagged `diag-ext` — they are inert under modifiers (not selectable, no source link). Nodes that are selected on the main map render here with the same yellow highlight (`diag-selected` on the side `[data-diag-node]` / main `.mn-card`, recoloured by `#node-modal-diagram … .diag-selected > rect` in the CSS). Toggling selection runs `markPopupSelected(id)`, which updates **every** card for that node — a cycle node appears twice (once as fan-in, once as fan-out) plus possibly the central card, and all toggle together. External cards show the library name (without the `ext:` prefix) and no metrics; an opened external main card uses the same layout as an internal file card — a centred title plus left-aligned `key: value` rows: `kind` (`external`), `version`, and the cargo-cache `path` (e.g. `{registry}/tokio-1.49.0`). The modal field table (left) lists every external field — `id`, `kind`, `version`, `external`, plus the full path — and routes metric rows through the same `#tt`/`COL_FORMULAS` tooltip, with the tooltip attached to the whole `<tr>` so it fires on both the key and the value. The main node card shows `path` / `hk` / `loc` (no `id`) — its labels carry the same `#tt` tooltips (incl. the `hk` computation); a `visibility` row is shown only when **not** `public` (e.g. `private`), since `public` is the default and appears in the left field list; a **plain click on the whole card copies** its path (`.mn-card` + `data-copy`; a modifier click acts instead of copying — see modal.js), and on copy it flashes the copied value above a centred `copied` confirmation for ~1s (no native `<title>`, to avoid conflicting with `#tt`). The metric table spells out abbreviated keys via `NM_LABELS` (`hk` → "Henry-Kafura", `mi` → "Maintainability Index", `mi_sei` → "Maintainability Index (SEI)", `fan_in`/`fan_out` → "Fan-in"/"Fan-out"). `MAX_ITEMS = 24` per column. Columns wrap **wide-first** — up to `MAX_COL_CARDS` (6) cards per row, then a new row below — so a busy fan-in/out spreads horizontally instead of growing into a tall stack. For project (non-external) files the left field table adds a **Source** row after `path` — a link to the file on the project's git host, built by `gitWebBase`/`gitSourceUrl` from the snapshot's `git.origin` (SSH/HTTPS normalized to a web blob URL: GitLab `/-/blob/`, GitHub `/blob/`) at `git.commit`, anchored to `#L<line>` when the node has one. `setupTooltips` also wires two map modifier gestures that skip the modal: **Shift-click** toggles a node's selection (`toggleNodeSelected` — syncs the shared `_ntSelected` set, the row, its checkbox and the footer), and the **"open source" modifier-click** (`⌘` on macOS, `Ctrl` elsewhere — `IS_MAC`/`isOpenSrcClick`) opens the node's source (`nodeSourceUrl` → `window.open`, project files only). A window `keydown`/`keyup`/`blur` listener (`initMapModifiers`, keyed on `OPEN_SRC_KEY`) toggles `body.shift-select` / `body.ctrl-link` for the cursor cues. |
| `nav.js` | `openModalForNode(nodeId)` — looks up node data first in `window.DIFF.files.nodes`, then falls back to the raw snapshot (`window.AFTER ?? window.BEFORE`) to support external library nodes that are excluded from the diff. Calls `window.hideMetricTooltip()` before re-rendering so a tooltip anchored to the replaced element never lingers over the new content. |
| `node-table.js` | Sortable per-file table ("**Details**" section, collapsed by default). The header shows the title + row-count badge always; the **search box and `⎘ Copy <N> selected` button appear only when expanded** (CSS on `.node-table-wrap.collapsed`); the copy button shows the live selected-row count. `cyclomatic`/`cognitive` columns are omitted; non-name columns are narrow. A **summary footer row** (`.nt-foot`) shows the **average** for each numeric column and a **count** for text columns (Name = total rows; Cycle = nodes in a cycle); its numeric cells carry a `data-tt` percentile distribution (p1/p10/p50/p90/p99 via `pctOf`) shown through the shared `#tt` tooltip, exactly like the summary section. Metric tooltips elsewhere in the table are derived **lazily** on hover (`setupTooltip`), never precomputed per cell. `window.hideMetricTooltip()` (and a capture-phase document `click` handler) force-hides `#tt` so it never lingers when popup nodes are switched or the modal closes. |
| `summary.js` | Review/diff summary table. Per-metric rows show the median (`p50`) with a `data-tt` percentile-distribution tooltip (`nodePercentiles`). `COL_NAMES`/`COL_TIPS`/`COL_FORMULAS` (full name / description / formula per column id) are the single source of truth reused by the node table and popup. The **Nodes-in-cycles** row's tooltip lists the cycle-group counts per kind (e.g. `mutual: 1, chain: 2`) from the active snapshot's `cycles`. |

**Affected status**: unchanged nodes/edges adjacent to changed (added/removed)
nodes or edges are promoted to `affected` status. Computed in `diff.js`
`computeDiff()` (browser-side), not in Rust.

**Cycle detection**: `computeCycles()` in `diff.js` runs Tarjan SCC on the
before and after adjacency lists of the file graph. Edges to external library
nodes are excluded from SCC construction (a leaf library cannot close a cycle).
Nodes/edges receive `cycle-status-{before-only|after-only|both|none}` class in
the DOT output, and the summary table reports cycle counts. Cycle members are
**always drawn with a red stroke** — `index.css` colours any non-`none`
`cycle-status-*` node/edge red unconditionally (no toggle); the per-node popup
(`diagram.js`) marks cycle nodes red the same way via `isCycleNode`.

**Offline guarantee**: no CDN references in any asset; `graphviz.umd.js`
embeds the WASM binary as a base91-encoded string and instantiates it from
an `ArrayBuffer` — works from `file://` with no network access.

### 3.3 API Contracts

Interfaces are defined in PRD §7. This section notes the implementation
binding.

#### Unified CLI (`cpt-code-split-interface-cli`)

- **Technology**: Rust binary with `clap`-derived subcommands
  (`check`, `report`, `diff`; no default command)
- **Location**: `crates/code-split-cli/src/main.rs`
- **Output**: `report` writes a snapshot `.json` to
  `{--report-path}/{ts}-{git-hash-3}.json` (default dir `.code-split`); name
  tunable via `--json-name` flag or `[output] json-name` config, directory via
  `--report-path`

#### Plugins (built-in, in-process)

Plugins are not external binaries. The three plugins — `rust`, `python`,
`javascript` — are compiled into the `code-split` binary and invoked
in-process; each writes its graphs directly into the shared `GraphBuilder`.
See [§3.7 Plugin System](#37-plugin-system).

#### Report Generator (`cpt-code-split-interface-report-cli`)

- **Technology**: built-in Rust renderer in `code-split-cli`
- **Location**: `crates/code-split-cli/src/main.rs` (`run_report`)
- **Template**: inline HTML string with all JS/CSS embedded

#### Diff Engine (`cpt-code-split-interface-diff-cli`)

- **Technology**: built-in Rust renderer in `code-split-cli`
- **Location**: `crates/code-split-cli/src/main.rs` (`run_diff`)

#### Graph JSON Schema (`cpt-code-split-interface-graph-schema`)

- **Location**: defined by `Snapshot`, `Node`, `Edge` structs in

### 3.4 Internal Dependencies

| Consumer | Dependency | Interface |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| `code-split-cli` | `code-split-syn` | `analyze(workspace, &mut GraphBuilder)` |
| `code-split-cli` | `code-split-complexity` | `analyze(workspace, &mut GraphBuilder) -> Result<usize>` |
| `code-split-cli` | `code-split-core` | `GraphBuilder`, `compare_snapshots()`, `serde_json` serialization |
| `code-split-syn` | `code-split-core` | `GraphBuilder` write API |
| `code-split-complexity` | `code-split-core` | `GraphBuilder` read+write API, `Complexity` struct |
| `code-split-cli` (`run_report`) | snapshot `.json` | top-level metadata + `graphs` object |
| `code-split-cli` (`run_diff`) | two snapshot `.json` files | top-level metadata + `graphs` objects from both |
| `code-split-cli` (`run_compare`) | two snapshot `.json` files | `CompareSummary` JSON or self-contained HTML via `render_compare_html` |

**Rules**:

- No circular dependencies among the four Rust crates.
- Only `code-split-syn` may depend on `cargo_metadata` and `syn`.
- Only `code-split-complexity` may depend on `rust-code-analysis`.
- `code-split-core` has zero I/O and zero analyzer dependencies.
- The Rust plugin's module→file collapse lives in
  `code-split-cli/src/plugin/rust.rs`, downstream of `code-split-syn`.
- `code-split-cli` reads JSON artifacts from disk; no in-process coupling
  between the analysis crates and the report/diff rendering code.

### 3.5 External Dependencies

| Dependency | Interface | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| `cargo_metadata` crate | `MetadataCommand::exec()` | Enumerate workspace crates and path-dependencies |

| `rust-code-analysis` (fork: `ffedoroff/rust-code-analysis`, branch `patch/update-tree-sitter-0.26.8`) | `metrics(&parser, path) -> Option<FuncSpace>` | Tree-sitter-based multi-language complexity metrics |
| `petgraph` crate | `DiGraph` | Internal graph storage |
| `serde` + `serde_json` | derive macros, `to_writer_pretty` | JSON serialization |
| `clap` | derive macros | CLI argument parsing |
| Python stdlib | `json`, `pathlib`, `argparse` | JSON processing, file I/O, CLI parsing in Python tools |

#### Step 2 — Report Generation

**ID**: `cpt-code-split-seq-report`

`report` re-analyzes the workspace (the same plugin pipeline as Step 1) and
then writes artifacts.

    Diff ->> Diff: validate schema version compatibility
    Diff ->> Diff: compute GraphDiff on the files graph (added/removed nodes & edges, weight delta)
    Diff ->> Diff: promote unchanged nodes/edges adjacent to changes → affected status
    Diff ->> Diff: determine coupling direction verdict (improved / degraded / neutral)
    Diff ->> Diff: embed both snapshots inline as cs-before / cs-after JSON script tags
    Diff ->> FS: write index.html (self-contained: all assets + data embedded from binary) [--format html, default]
    Diff ->> FS: write diff.json (machine-readable diff + verdict) [--format json]
    Diff -->> User: exit 0
```

### 3.7 Plugin System

#### Plugin Resolution

All plugins are built into the `code-split` binary; there is no external
or dynamic plugin loading. Resolution only selects which built-in plugin
to run.

The plugin defaults to `auto`. When `--plugin auto`, the analysis core
(behind `check` / `report`) resolves the plugin *name* in this order,
stopping at the first match:

```
1. Explicit flag    --plugin <name> (≠ auto) on the command line
                    → use that built-in plugin

2. Config           the `plugin` key in code-split.toml /
                    Cargo.toml metadata (if set and ≠ auto)
                    → use that built-in plugin

3. Auto-detect      project markers in the workspace root:
                    Cargo.toml → rust;
                    pyproject.toml / setup.py / setup.cfg → python;
                    package.json / tsconfig.json → javascript
```

The resolved name must be one of the three compiled-in plugins — `rust`,
`python`, or `javascript` (JS+TS) — which is then invoked in-process.
Multiple matching markers or none → error asking for an explicit
`--plugin`.

#### Snapshot File Format

`code-split report` writes the snapshot into `--report-path` (default
`.code-split` in the current working directory) with a templated name —
default `{ts}-{git-hash-3}.json` (timestamp + first 3 chars of the commit):

```
.code-split/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<hash3>.json
```

The name template is resolved as **`--json-name` flag › `[output] json-name`
in config › built-in default**, with placeholders `{project-dir}` (slugified
workspace name), `{ts}`, `{git-hash}` (12-char short commit) and `{git-hash-N}`
(first N chars). Example: `code-split report /path/to/axum-api --plugin rust
--format json` → `.code-split/20260522-112233-a3f.json` (or
`axum-api-20260522-112233.json` if `[output] json-name = "{project-dir}-{ts}.json"`).

The file combines metadata and the single `files` graph in one document:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "generated_at":   "2026-05-22T11:22:33Z",
  "command":        "code-split report /path/to/axum-api --plugin rust --format json",
  "workspace":      "/Users/alice/projects/code-split",
  "target":         "/Users/alice/projects/axum-api",
  "plugin":         "rust",
  "local_only":     false,
  "versions": {
    "code-split": "0.3.1",
    "plugin_rust": "0.3.1",
    "rustc": "1.78.0"
  },
  "roots": {
    "cargo":    "/Users/alice/.cargo",
    "registry": "/Users/alice/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-abc123",
    "rustup":   "/Users/alice/.rustup",
    "rust-src": "/Users/alice/.rustup/toolchains/stable-aarch64-apple-darwin/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library"
  },
  "git": {
    "branch": "refactor/split-handlers",
    "commit": "a3f9c21b4d5e",
    "dirty_files": 4,
    "origin": "git@gitlab.example.com:team/axum-api.git"
  },
  "graphs": {
    "files": { "nodes": [...], "edges": [...] }
  }
}
```

`workspace` is the directory where `code-split` was invoked (cwd). `target`
is the analyzed project path. `roots` are named prefixes for path
resolution: `roots[name] + "/" + rest` → absolute path. All node `path`
values and `file:` IDs use `{name}/…` notation referencing these roots.

The Rust plugin populates roots automatically via `detect_roots()`:

| Root | Source | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| `target` | analyzed project path | `/path/to/my-crate` |
| `cargo` | `$CARGO_HOME` or `~/.cargo` | `/Users/alice/.cargo` |
| `registry` | first `index.crates.io-*` dir under cargo | `.../registry/src/index.crates.io-abc123` |
| `rustup` | `$RUSTUP_HOME` or `~/.rustup` | `/Users/alice/.rustup` |
| `rust-src` | `rustc --print sysroot` + `/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library` | `.../toolchains/stable-aarch64-apple-darwin/.../library` |

`rust-src` is only added when the path exists on disk; omitted otherwise.
It shortens stdlib paths like `{rustup}/toolchains/stable-aarch64-apple-darwin/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/alloc/src/vec/mod.rs`
to `{rust-src}/alloc/src/vec/mod.rs`.

**Assembly**: the built-in plugin produces the `graphs` object in-process
(written into the shared `GraphBuilder`). `code-split` then runs
`relativize_graphs` + `rewrite_ids`, prepends all metadata fields, and
writes the final snapshot file.

`rewrite_ids` rewrites node `id` and edge `from`/`to` fields, applying
path relativization so an absolute `file:/abs/path` becomes
`file:{root}/…` using the named roots.

`versions.plugin_<name>` is the built-in plugin's version, which equals
the `code-split` binary's own version (all plugins ship inside it).

The `git` fields are collected by `code-split` before invoking the plugin:

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| `branch` | `git -C <workspace> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` |
| `commit` | `git -C <workspace> rev-parse --short=12 HEAD` (12-char short SHA) |
| `dirty_files` | `git -C <workspace> status --porcelain \| wc -l` |
| `origin` | `git -C <workspace> config --get remote.origin.url` (omitted if empty/absent) |

If branch/commit fail the `git` key is omitted entirely — no error is raised.
`origin` feeds the HTML viewer's per-node "Source" link (`git@host:grp/proj.git`
or `https://…` is normalized to a web blob URL — GitLab `/-/blob/`, GitHub
`/blob/` — at the commit).

`code-split report` (from the snapshot it just produced) and `code-split diff`
(from the two snapshot files it reads) embed this metadata in the generated
HTML as a visible "Snapshot info" panel.

#### Built-in Plugin: Rust

At P1 the only built-in plugin is `rust`. It is compiled directly into
the `code-split` binary and invoked in-process, so no sub-process overhead
is incurred. Its internal structure is the `code-split-syn` crate plus a
module→file collapse pass in `code-split-cli/src/plugin/rust.rs`; it is
not a separate binary on disk. There is no rust-analyzer dependency, so
the run completes in seconds.

##### Analysis Modes and Prerequisites

The Rust plugin has two modes selected by flags on the analyzing commands
(`code-split check` / `code-split report`):

| Mode | Flag | `cargo` required | Network / registry | External nodes |
|------|------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| Full | *(none)* | yes | yes (or cached) | yes |
| Local-only | `--local-only` | yes | no | not enumerated |

The project does NOT need to compile in any mode — `syn` parses source
syntactically and tolerates errors. Only dependency resolution
(`cargo metadata`) is required for full mode.

##### Full Mode — Step-by-Step

```
code-split report /path/to/my-crate --plugin rust
```

1. `code-split-cli` creates the output directory (`--report-path`, default
   `.code-split/`).
2. Collects git state (`branch`, `commit`, `dirty_files`) from
   `/path/to/my-crate`.
3. Invokes `code-split-syn::analyze`:
   a. Runs `cargo metadata --format-version=1` inside the workspace.
   b. Identifies all local packages (those with a `path` source).
   c. For each local package, locates the crate root (`lib.rs` /
      `main.rs` / `[lib] path`).
   d. Recursively follows `mod foo;` declarations using `syn`, building
      the module tree and collecting all `use` / `pub use` statements.
   e. Emits `Crate`, `Module`, `Trait` nodes and `Contains`, `Uses`,
      `Reexports` edges into `GraphBuilder`.
   f. External crates are added as opaque `Crate` nodes with
      `external = true`; their source is never read.
4. Invokes `code-split-complexity::analyze`:
   a. Walks all `.rs` files in the workspace with `walkdir`.
   b. For each file, parses it with `rust-code-analysis` to obtain a
      `FuncSpace` tree.
   c. Annotates each file-backed `Module` node with whole-file metrics
      from the root space (matched by canonical path).
5. Collapses the module graph to a **file graph** (in `plugin/rust.rs`):
   a. Every `.rs` file becomes one `File` node (`file:<path>`); inline
      `mod {}` modules fold into their containing file.
   b. `Uses` / `Reexports` / `Contains` edges are re-pointed from module
      ids to the file ids that own them, so file→file connections are
      preserved. Cross-file `Contains` edges (`mod foo;` declarations) are
      **kept** in the snapshot as structural ownership metadata, but are
      not drawn / not counted in fan_in / HK / cycles; self-edges and
      crate→crate `Contains` are dropped.
   c. External crates collapse to `External` library nodes (`ext:<name>`)
      at depth 1; edges into them are flagged `external: true`. Each carries
      its cargo-cache `path` (the crate's `Cargo.toml` directory, e.g.
      `{registry}/tokio-1.49.0`), later relativized to a `{registry}`/`{cargo}`
      root.
   d. A **local** workspace crate maps to its crate-root file (`lib.rs` /
      `main.rs`), so a cross-crate `use other_crate::…` (or captured
      bare-path reference) becomes a file→file edge to that crate's root.
      Crate→crate dependency edges (from `cargo metadata`) are dropped as
      crate-level meta.
6. Runs `annotate_all_cycles` (SCC → `CycleKind`) and `annotate_hk`
   (internal `fan_in`/`fan_out`/`hk`; `fan_out_external` separately) on
   the file graph, then `annotate_stats`. Named roots that did not shorten
   any node path are pruned (`prune_unused_roots`), so the header lists only
   relevant roots.
7. Writes the final snapshot `.json` (metadata + `timings` + `files` graph)
   via `to_canonical_string_pretty` — canonical, byte-stable JSON.

##### Local-Only Mode — Step-by-Step

```
code-split report /path/to/my-crate --plugin rust --local-only
```

Steps are identical to full mode except `cargo metadata` is called with
`--no-deps`, so external packages are not enumerated and
`metadata.resolve` is `None`. The file graph and per-file complexity are
still produced; there are simply fewer (or no) `External` library nodes.

Use this mode when dependencies are unreachable or you only need the
internal file graph.

##### Failure Modes

| Situation | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `cargo` not on `$PATH` | exit 1 — "cargo not found" (the Rust plugin requires `cargo` for `cargo metadata`) |
| `cargo metadata` fails (dependency resolution error) | exit 1 — cargo stderr forwarded verbatim + hint to try `--local-only` |
| Workspace member glob matches no directories | warning logged; zero crates emitted for that glob |
| A source file has a syntax error | `syn` parse failure logged as a warning; file is skipped; analysis continues |
| Output directory not writable | exit 1 before analysis starts |

#### P3 Framework-Specific Plugins

Framework plugins (Django, WordPress, etc.) MAY emit additional metadata
beyond the base schema vocabulary by using the `metadata` object on nodes
and edges. The `kind` field MUST remain one of the base kinds (`file`,
`external`) so base consumers can still process the graph.
Framework-specific semantics are expressed in `metadata.<plugin>.*` keys
and are ignored by base consumers.

Example — a Django-specific annotation on a file node:

```json
{
  "id": "file:{target}/myapp/signals.py",
  "kind": "file",
  "name": "signals.py",
  "path": "{target}/myapp/signals.py",
  "metadata": {
    "django": {
      "signal": "post_save",
      "sender": "User"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.8 CLI Examples

#### Snapshots — `code-split report --format json`

`code-split report` always re-analyzes the project and writes the snapshot
to `--report-path` (default `.code-split/`) under the name template
(default `{ts}-{git-hash-3}.json`, e.g. `.code-split/20260522-112233-a3f.json`;
override via `--json-name` flag or `[output] json-name` config).

**Rust (built-in)**

```bash
# 1. Default snapshot: .code-split/20260522-112233-a3f.json ({ts}-{git-hash-3})
code-split report . --plugin rust --format json

# 2. Explicit file name — for a named state
code-split report . --plugin rust --format json --json-name before-refactor.json

# 3. Local-only mode — file graph without external dependency resolution
code-split report . --plugin rust --local-only --format json
# → .code-split/my-crate-20260522-114500.json, "local_only": true
```

**Python (built-in)**

```bash
# 1. Default dated snapshot
code-split report ~/projects/my-lib --plugin python --format json

# 2. Explicit name for a named state
code-split report . --plugin python --format json --json-name v2.4.0.json

# 3. Pass the root package via plugin-args
code-split report . --plugin python --format json -- --root-package src/myapp
# → .code-split/my-lib-20260522-120000.json
```

**JavaScript / TypeScript (built-in)**

```bash
# 1. Default dated snapshot
code-split report ~/projects/frontend --plugin javascript --format json

# 2. Explicit tsconfig via plugin-args
code-split report . --plugin javascript --format json -- --tsconfig ./packages/core/tsconfig.json

# 3. Only src/, ignore node_modules and dist
code-split report . --plugin javascript --format json \
    --json-name src-only.json \
    --ignore node_modules --ignore dist -- --root src
```

---

#### Visualization — `code-split report`

`report` always re-analyzes the project and writes the snapshot `.json` **and** the
HTML viewer together.

```bash
# 1. Snapshot + report side by side, in .code-split/ (default format json,html)
code-split report . --plugin rust
open .code-split/20260522-112233-a3f.html   # default {ts}-{git-hash-3}.html

# 2. Report in docs/ for sharing with the team
code-split report . --plugin rust \
    --report-path docs --html-name coupling.html

# 3. CI: analyze the project → artifacts into the CI folder
code-split report . --plugin rust \
    --report-path /artifacts/code-split --html-name report-pr-1234.html
```

---

#### Diff — `code-split diff`

`diff` compares two existing snapshots (no analysis). The default is
`--format html` (`index.html`); `--format json` writes a machine-readable
`diff.json` with a verdict for CI.

```bash
# 1. Before and after a refactor — HTML viewer
code-split diff \
    --before .code-split/app-20260520-093000.json \
    --after  .code-split/app-20260522-112233.json \
    --html-name diff-20260522.html

# 2. Named snapshots
code-split diff \
    --before .code-split/before-refactor.json \
    --after  .code-split/after-refactor.json \
    --html-name diff-refactor.html

# 3. CI: main vs PR, JSON verdict for a PR comment
code-split diff \
    --before /artifacts/code-split/main.json \
    --after  /artifacts/code-split/pr-1234.json \
    --report-path /artifacts/code-split --format json
cat /artifacts/code-split/diff.json | jq '.verdict'
```

---

#### Full end-to-end workflow

```bash
# Steps 1+2: snapshot before the refactor + report (report does both)
code-split report . --plugin rust --json-name before.json
open .code-split/20260522-112233-a3f.html   # {ts}-{git-hash-3}.html, inspect the heavy nodes

# -- Step 3: the user makes changes (by hand or with an AI) --

# Steps 1+2 again: snapshot after the changes + report
code-split report . --plugin rust --json-name after.json

# Step 4: diff the two snapshots
code-split diff \
    --before .code-split/before.json \
    --after  .code-split/after.json \
    --html-name diff.html
open .code-split/diff.html

# Alternative: report + compare against a baseline in one run (--before)
code-split report . --plugin rust --before .code-split/before.json
open .code-split/my-crate-20260522-112233-diff.html   # --before names it -diff.html; already a diff view + verdict
```

**Module→file collapse trade-off**: Rust dependencies are expressed via
module paths (`use crate::foo::bar`), not file paths. Rather than emit a
separate module graph, the Rust plugin builds the module tree and then
collapses it to files — folding inline `mod {}` modules into their file
and re-pointing `use`/`pub use` edges to files — so file→file
connections are fully preserved in the single graph model. There is no
function-level call graph: resolving call sites semantically would
require rust-analyzer (slow, volatile), which has been removed.

**HTML asset bundling**: All JS/CSS assets for `code-split report` and
`code-split diff` are embedded into the binary via `include_str!`. The
Graphviz WASM bundle is committed under
`crates/code-split-cli/src/assets/` and never fetched at runtime.
Generated HTML files work offline via `file://` with no network access.

- **PRD**: [PRD.md](PRD.md)
- **Graph JSON Schema**: `crates/code-split-core/schemas/graph.schema.json`
- **ADRs**: pending — `docs/ADR/0001-files-only-graph.md` and
  `docs/ADR/0002-four-step-pipeline.md` to be authored after this
  design is accepted

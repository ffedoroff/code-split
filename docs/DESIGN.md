## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architectural Vision

Code Split is a four-step pipeline: **extract → visualize → (user
modifies) → diff**. The platform is built around a single portable
JSON artifact format that decouples the extraction layer (plugins) from
the consumption layer (report generator, diff engine). Either layer can
evolve independently as long as the schema version is respected.

At P1 the platform ships three components:

- **Rust Plugin** (`code-split-rust`): a Cargo workspace analyzer built
  on `syn` (syntactic analysis). It builds the Rust module graph and
  collapses it to a single **file graph**; outputs a single snapshot
  `.json` file per run
- **Report Generator** (`code-split report`): built into `code-split-cli`;
  re-analyzes the workspace and writes artifacts — a snapshot `.json`
  and/or a single self-contained offline HTML viewer (optionally a diff
  view against a `--before` baseline in the same run); all JS/CSS assets
  embedded in the binary via `include_str!`
- **Diff Engine** (`code-split diff`): built into `code-split-cli`; compares
  two existing snapshot files (no analysis); produces an interactive HTML
  diff report (client-side layout, a single Files view, a Before/After
  toggle that renders each snapshot as its own clean diagram) and/or a
  machine-readable JSON diff with an `improved` / `degraded` / `neutral` verdict

The three pillars of the design are:

1. **JSON-first artifact contract** — the single snapshot file is the
   sole handoff between all components; any plugin can feed any
   consumer
2. **Offline-first** — every P1 component runs without network access;
   generated HTML reports inline all assets
3. **Pluggable extraction layer** — the built-in plugins (`rust`,
   `python`, `javascript`) all produce the same JSON artifact, so new
   languages can be added as built-in plugins without touching the
   consumer tools

### 1.2 Architecture Drivers

#### Functional Drivers

| Requirement | Design Response |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `cpt-code-split-fr-rust-plugin` | Implemented by `code-split-syn`, orchestrated in-process by `code-split-cli`'s `plugin::rust` module, which collapses the module graph to a file graph. Outputs a single snapshot `.json`. |
| `cpt-code-split-fr-lang-plugins` (Python, JS/TS) | Python: `plugin::python` using `tree-sitter-python`. JS/TS: `plugin::javascript` using `tree-sitter-javascript` / `tree-sitter-typescript`, supporting both ESM and CommonJS. Both emit `File` nodes + file→file `uses` edges + `External` library nodes, and annotate per-file complexity via `code-split-complexity`. |
| `cpt-code-split-fr-file-graph` | All plugins emit a single file graph: `File` nodes with `uses` / `reexports` edges between files, plus `External` library nodes at depth 1 reached by `uses` edges flagged `external: true`. The Rust plugin derives it by collapsing its module graph; Python/JS/TS build it directly from import resolution. |
| `cpt-code-split-fr-local-only` | `--local-only` passes `--no-deps` to `cargo metadata`; external dependencies are not enumerated. The file graph and per-file complexity are still produced. |
| `cpt-code-split-fr-html-report` | Built-in Rust renderer in `code-split-cli`: `report` re-analyzes the workspace, then renders an HTML template with inline assets alongside the JSON snapshot. |
| `cpt-code-split-fr-node-sorting` | Node weight (fan-in + fan-out) is computed at render time and embedded in the HTML; client-side JavaScript sorts the table on user interaction. |
| `cpt-code-split-fr-graph-diff` | Built-in diff in `code-split-cli`: reads two snapshot files, performs node/edge set difference on the file graph, computes weight delta per node. |
| `cpt-code-split-fr-diff-html-report` | The diff data structure is rendered into a self-contained HTML template with color-coded before/after views; all assets inlined. |
| `cpt-code-split-fr-diff-text-report` | The diff data structure is serialized to a machine-readable JSON diff (`diff --format json`) with counts, top-delta nodes, and the `improved` / `degraded` / `neutral` verdict for CI parsing. |

#### NFR Allocation

| NFR ID | Summary | Allocated To | Design Response |
|--------|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| `cpt-code-split-nfr-offline` | Zero outbound network calls | All components | Rust plugin: no HTTP; `code-split report` / `code-split diff`: HTML assets embedded in binary, no CDN references in generated output. |
| `cpt-code-split-nfr-performance` | ≤ 30 s @ 50k LOC (plugin); ≤ 5 s @ 10k nodes (report/diff) | `code-split-syn`, `code-split-complexity`, `code-split-cli` | Syntactic analysis + the module→file collapse run in seconds (no rust-analyzer); report/diff subcommands process JSON in a single pass. |
| `cpt-code-split-nfr-portability` | JSON artifacts stable within a major version | All components | Schema version field in `meta`; diff tool aborts on mismatch; additive-only changes within a major version. |

## 2. Principles & Constraints

### 2.1 Design Principles

#### JSON Artifact Contract as the Sole Integration Surface

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-principle-json-contract`

The single JSON snapshot file (one `files` graph plus metadata) is the
ONLY handoff between the plugin layer and the consumer layer. No
in-process coupling between the analysis crates and the report/diff
rendering code is permitted. This contract is versioned via
`schema_version`; the diff tool aborts on a version mismatch.

#### Offline-First

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-principle-offline-first`

Every P1 component must work without network access. Generated HTML
files must contain no external resource references. This is a design
constraint, not a preference — it must be verified in CI.

#### Files-Only Graph Model

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-principle-files-only`

The snapshot carries exactly one graph level: **files**. Node kinds in
output are `File` (a project source file, carrying all metrics) and
`External` (a third-party library, recorded at depth 1 — one node per
library, never expanded). Edge kinds are `uses` and `reexports` between
files, plus `uses` edges flagged `external: true` from a file to a
library node. There is no module, function, or call graph: language
plugins resolve everything down to file→file dependencies before the
snapshot is written.

#### Internal Coupling Excludes External Libraries

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-principle-internal-coupling`

`fan_in`, `fan_out`, and Henry-Kafura (`HK = loc × (fan_in × fan_out)²`)
are computed from **internal** file→file edges only. Edges to `External`
library nodes are excluded from these counts and from HK, and are
surfaced separately in `coupling.fan_out_external`. Rationale: HK
measures internal architectural coupling, not the breadth of 3rd-party
library usage, which would otherwise drown out real structural signal.

#### Pluggable Extraction, Stable Consumers

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-principle-pluggable`

The report generator and diff engine are schema consumers, not
language-aware tools. Adding a new language plugin MUST NOT require
changes to any consumer tool. All language-specific knowledge lives
exclusively in the plugin.

### 2.2 Constraints

#### Stable Rust Toolchain

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-constraint-stable-rust`

The Rust plugin must build on stable Rust. `rustc_private` and
nightly-only features are prohibited.

#### Python 3.9+ Minimum

- [x] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-constraint-python`

The built-in Python language plugin targets Python 3.9+ as the minimum
version to analyze. No Python runtime is required by the `code-split`
binary itself; the constraint applies to the target workspace being
analyzed, not the execution environment.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Domain Model

**Technology**: Rust structs and enums in `code-split-core`; JSON schema
in `crates/code-split-core/schemas/graph.schema.json`.

| Entity | Description | Location |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Graph | Ordered collection of nodes and edges; serialized to JSON as the single `files` graph | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| Node | `id`, `kind`, `name`, `path?`, `external?`, `visibility?`, `complexity?`, `cycle_kind?` | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| Edge | `from`, `to`, `kind`, `external?`, `visibility?` | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| NodeKind | Enum. Output kinds: `File` (a project source file), `External` (a 3rd-party library at depth 1). The variants `Crate`, `Module`, `Trait` are internal-only — used by `code-split-syn` while building the Rust module tree and collapsed into `File`/`External` by the Rust plugin before serialization; they never appear in a snapshot. | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| EdgeKind | Enum. Output kinds: `Uses`, `Reexports` (both between files; `Uses` to an `External` node when the edge is flagged `external`). `Contains` is internal-only (Rust module-tree ownership during construction); the collapse drops same-file `Contains` (inline modules) but **re-emits cross-file `Contains` as `Uses`** — a `mod foo;` declaration of a separate file is a real `lib.rs → foo.rs` dependency. So `Contains` never appears between files in output. | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| CycleKind | Enum: `TestEmbed` (Rust `#[cfg(test)]` back-edge), `Mutual` (SCC size 2), `Chain` (SCC size ≥ 3). Set on each node in a cycle via `cycle_kind`. | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| CycleGroup | SCC with ≥ 2 nodes: `kind: CycleKind`, `nodes: Vec<NodeId>`. Stored in `Graph.cycles`. | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| NodeId | Stable string key with no line numbers or byte offsets. Schemes: `file:{path}` for a source file, `ext:{name}` for an external library. | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs`, `crates/code-split-core/src/snapshot.rs` |
| Complexity | Nested code-metrics object on a node. Top-level scalars: `cyclomatic`, `cognitive`, `exits`, `args`, `functions`, `closures` (zero-valued fields omitted). Sub-objects: `coupling?` (`fan_in`, `fan_out`, `fan_out_external`, `hk` — omitted when all fan values are 0), `maintainability?` (`mi`, `mi_sei`), `loc?` (`source`, `logical`, `comments`, `blank`), `halstead?` (`length`, `vocabulary`, `volume`, `effort`, `time`, `bugs`). Entire `complexity` object omitted when all sub-fields are zero/absent. Present on `File` nodes; absent on `External` nodes. All numeric fields use 3-significant-digit truncation; whole numbers serialized without decimal point. | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| Coupling | `fan_in`, `fan_out` (internal file→file counts), `fan_out_external` (distinct external libraries depended on), `hk` (Henry-Kafura from internal counts only). | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| AvgCoupling | Average coupling stored inside `GraphStats`: `fan_in`, `fan_out`, `hk` (all f64, zero-valued fields omitted). | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs` |
| GraphStats | Optional summary attached to the `files` graph after all annotations. Mirrors the `Complexity` node structure with averages: top-level `cyclomatic`, `cognitive`; sub-objects `coupling?` (`AvgCoupling`), `maintainability?`, `loc?`, `halstead?`. Zero-valued scalar fields and absent sub-objects are omitted. Percentiles are not stored — the viewer computes them client-side from raw node data. Populated by `annotate_stats()` in `code-split-core`. | `crates/code-split-core/src/graph.rs`, `crates/code-split-core/src/stats.rs` |
| Snapshot | A single `.json` file combining `workspace` (cwd), `target` (analyzed project), `plugin`, `config_file?` (path of loaded config file, omitted when none), `roots` (named path prefixes), `versions`, `git`, `timings`, and a `graphs` object with a single key: `files` | `crates/code-split-core/src/snapshot.rs` |
| StageTime | Per-stage timing entry: `stage` (name), `ms` (elapsed milliseconds), `detail` (human summary). Stored in `Snapshot.timings` in execution order. | `crates/code-split-core/src/snapshot.rs` |
| GraphDiff | Computed from two `Snapshot`s: per-level sets of added/removed nodes and edges, weight-delta per node, coupling direction verdict | `crates/code-split-cli/src/main.rs` |

**Relationships**:

- `Node` → `Node`: linked via `Edge`.
- `Graph` → `Node`/`Edge`: ownership; nodes carry an optional `parent`
  pointing to the containing node.
- `GraphDiff` is computed from two `Snapshot`s and owns no graph data —
  it references node IDs only.

### 3.2 Component Model

#### code-split-core

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-component-core`

Provides the shared vocabulary: graph types, kind enums, the
`GraphBuilder` API, and the JSON serialization logic. Has zero I/O.
Depends on `petgraph` and `serde` only; no `cargo_metadata` or `syn`.

Modules beyond graph types:

- **`cycles.rs`** — `annotate_all_cycles`: Kosaraju SCC on the file
  graph, classifies each SCC as `TestEmbed` / `Mutual` / `Chain`, sets
  `node.cycle_kind` and writes `graph.cycles: Vec<CycleGroup>`.
- **`hk.rs`** — `annotate_hk`: computes Henry-Kafura complexity
  (`hk = loc × (fan_in × fan_out)²`) for every file node and writes the
  result into `node.complexity.coupling`
  (`Coupling { fan_in, fan_out, fan_out_external, hk }`). `fan_in` /
  `fan_out` count **internal** file→file `uses`/`reexports` edges only;
  edges flagged `external` are excluded and counted into
  `fan_out_external` instead, so HK reflects internal coupling rather
  than 3rd-party library breadth. The `loc` factor is the same one shown
  in `complexity.loc` (`loc.source`). With no loc or no internal
  in/out coupling, `hk` is 0.
- **`diff.rs`** — `compare_snapshots(before, after) -> CompareSummary`:
  mirrors `computeDiff()` from `diff.js`; computes added/removed/affected/
  unchanged counts for nodes and edges in the file graph, then propagates
  `affected` to unchanged nodes adjacent to changed edges. Used by
  `code-split diff --format json`.

#### code-split-syn

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-component-syn`

Produces the Rust module graph via syntactic analysis. Calls
`cargo metadata`; classifies crates as local vs. external; walks local
source trees with `syn` to extract the module hierarchy and `use` /
`pub use` statements, emitting `Crate` / `Module` / `Trait` nodes and
`Contains` / `Uses` / `Reexports` edges. It also runs a `syn::visit`
path collector over each file to capture **crate-qualified bare paths**
in expressions/types (`other_crate::item`, no `use`), resolved against
the extern-crate map only (cross-crate; `crate`/`self`/`super`/`std`
are ignored). External crates are added as `Crate` nodes with
`external = true`; their source is never read. A `visited_files`
`HashSet<PathBuf>` guard in `process_package` prevents double-walking
source files when a workspace has both `lib` and `bin` targets declaring
the same modules.

These module-level nodes are **internal**: the Rust plugin's collapse
pass (see §3.7) folds them down to `File` / `External` nodes before the
snapshot is written.

**Edge sources & remaining blind spots**: file→file / file→library edges
come from three sources — (1) `use` / `pub use` statements; (2) `mod foo;`
declarations of a separate file (the collapse re-emits cross-file
`Contains` as `Uses`); (3) crate-qualified bare paths in expressions/types
(`other_crate::item`), captured by the path visitor and resolved against
extern crates. So a sibling-crate or 3rd-party dependency reached only via
a fully-qualified path, and a child file reached via `mod foo;` + bare-path
call, both still get edges. What remains uncaptured: an **intra-crate**
bare path to a sibling module the caller neither `use`s nor declares
(`crate::other::fn()` with no `use`/`mod` in that file), and any `use`
hidden inside a macro body (macros are never expanded). Such a target may
show a lower `fan_in` than the real dependency, and a correspondingly
lower HK.

#### code-split-complexity

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-component-complexity`

Annotates `File` nodes (Rust file-backed module nodes before collapse,
and the `File` nodes of the Python/JS/TS plugins) in the `GraphBuilder`
with per-file code complexity metrics. Uses `rust-code-analysis`
(Mozilla, via the `ffedoroff/rust-code-analysis` fork on branch
`patch/update-tree-sitter-0.26.8`) which is built on tree-sitter and
supports Rust, C++, JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, Kotlin, and more.
Metrics are aggregated to the whole file (the root `FuncSpace` of each
parsed file).

**Interface**:
- `code_split_complexity::analyze(workspace, builder)` — Rust (`.rs` files)
- `code_split_complexity::analyze_python(workspace, builder)` — Python (`.py`)
- `code_split_complexity::analyze_js(workspace, builder)` — JS/TS (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`)

All three delegate to a shared `analyze_extensions` implementation.

**Matching strategy**: each file's metrics come from the top-level
`FuncSpace` (`SpaceKind::Unit`) of the parsed file, matched to the graph
node by canonical path via a `HashMap<canonical_path → node_idx>`. For
Rust this is applied to the file-backed `Module` nodes (before the
plugin collapses them to `File` nodes); for Python/JS/TS it is applied
to `File` nodes directly. The map is populated with `entry().or_insert(i)`
(not `insert`) so the first node for a path wins if two nodes share it.

**Metrics computed per file**:

| Category | Fields (in `complexity` object) |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| Scalars | `cyclomatic`, `cognitive`, `exits`, `args`, `functions`, `closures` |
| Coupling | `coupling.fan_in`, `coupling.fan_out`, `coupling.fan_out_external`, `coupling.hk` (added later by `annotate_hk`, not by this crate) |
| Maintainability | `maintainability.mi`, `maintainability.mi_sei` |
| Lines of Code | `loc.source`, `loc.logical`, `loc.comments`, `loc.blank` |
| Halstead | `halstead.length`, `halstead.vocabulary`, `halstead.volume`, `halstead.effort`, `halstead.time`, `halstead.bugs` |

Each language entry point is called by its plugin after graph
construction. Metrics are whole-file aggregates, so all functions,
methods, arrow functions, and closures in a file roll up into that
file's single node — there is no per-function granularity to miss.

#### plugin::python (built-in)

- [x] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-component-python-plugin`

In-process Python plugin implemented in `code-split-cli/src/plugin/python.rs`.
Uses `tree-sitter-python` (already a transitive dep via `rust-code-analysis`)
for AST traversal and `walkdir` for file discovery.

**Pipeline**:

1. **Scan** — walk all `.py` files under the workspace, skipping `.venv`,
   `__pycache__`, `node_modules`, and any dot-prefixed directory.
2. **Module index** — derive dotted module paths from file paths:
   `parser/shops/amazon/pdp.py` → `parser.shops.amazon.pdp`;
   `parser/shops/amazon/__init__.py` → `parser.shops.amazon`.
3. **Per-file node** — emit one `File` node per `.py` file.
4. **Import resolution** — resolve `import_statement` and
   `import_from_statement` nodes. Imports that resolve to a project file
   emit a file→file `uses` edge (including `__init__.py` package imports,
   which point at the package's `__init__.py` file); relative imports
   (`.`, `..`, `.submodule`) are resolved against the current module's
   package path. Imports that do not resolve to a project file produce an
   `External` library node (`ext:<top-level-package>`, one per top-level
   package such as `numpy`) reached by a `uses` edge flagged
   `external: true`.

**ID scheme**:
- File: `file:/abs/path/to/file.py` (relativized to `{target}/...` by
  `snapshot::relativize_graphs`)
- External library: `ext:numpy`

**Visibility heuristic**: `__name` (no trailing dunder) → `Private`;
`_name` → `Restricted { path: "module" }`; otherwise → `Public`.

**Complexity**: per-file metrics annotated via
`code_split_complexity::analyze_python` (whole-file aggregate; see §3.2
`code-split-complexity`).

#### plugin::javascript (built-in)

- [x] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-component-js-plugin`

In-process JavaScript / TypeScript plugin implemented in
`code-split-cli/src/plugin/javascript.rs`. Uses `tree-sitter-javascript` and
`tree-sitter-typescript` for AST traversal and `walkdir` for file discovery.

**Source root detection**: if `src/` exists in the workspace, scans from
`src/`; otherwise scans from the workspace root. This avoids picking up
non-source `.js` files (config, scripts, test fixtures) in projects that
follow the `src/` layout convention.

**Pipeline**:

1. **Scan** — walk `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx` files from source root,
   skipping `node_modules`, `dist`, `.venv`, dotfile directories,
   `.gen.ts`, `.config.ts/js`.
2. **File index** — map each file's relative path to its absolute path.
3. **Per-file node** — emit one `File` node per source file.
4. **Import resolution** — resolve ES `import` statements and CommonJS
   `require()` calls. Imports that resolve to a project file emit a
   file→file `uses` edge; handles the `@/` path alias (→ source root),
   relative paths, and index-file collapsing (extensions tried in order:
   `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `index.ts`, `index.tsx`, `index.js`,
   `index.jsx`). Imports that do not resolve to a project file produce an
   `External` library node (`ext:<package>`, one per top-level package —
   `react`, `@scope/pkg`) reached by a `uses` edge flagged
   `external: true`.

**ID scheme** (using `src` as the source root prefix):
- File: `file:/abs/path/to/file.ts` (relativized to `{target}/...`)
- External library: `ext:react`, `ext:@scope/pkg`

**Visibility heuristic**: `_name` → `Private`; otherwise → `Public`.

**Complexity**: per-file metrics annotated via
`code_split_complexity::analyze_js` (whole-file aggregate, covering all
functions, arrow functions, and methods in the file; see §3.2
`code-split-complexity`).

#### code-split-cli

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-component-cli`

The single user-facing binary `code-split`. There is no default command —
a bare invocation prints help. `main()` owns three subcommands:

The shared analysis core (used by both `check` and `report`) loads layered
config (`config.rs` — code-split.toml / Cargo.toml metadata / CLI flags);
resolves the plugin name (CLI `--plugin` → config `plugin` → marker
auto-detect, all under `auto`); invokes the selected built-in plugin
(`rust` / `python` / `javascript`) in-process. After the plugin run it calls
`relativize_graphs` + `rewrite_ids` from `code-split-core`, then applies
config filters: `config::apply_ignore` (path globs + `tests` /
`test_modules` test-file stripping + `dev_only_crates` via
`cargo metadata`), `annotate_all_cycles` + `config::apply_cycle_rules`,
`annotate_hk` + `annotate_stats`.

- **`check`** (the linter): runs the shared analysis core, then
  `config::check_violations` over cycle checks (`--cycle-rule <KIND=on|off|N>`,
  parsed into `config::CycleRule` = `Off` | `Max(n)`; a kind's cycles are reported
  only when their per-graph count exceeds its budget, so `Max(0)` is strict and
  `Max(7)` forbids the 8th) and metric thresholds (`--threshold
  <file.METRIC=N>`). No severity tiers. There is a single threshold
  scope — `file` (the files graph) — metrics written directly under
  `[rules.thresholds.file]`. `check_node_metrics` runs the per-file
  thresholds on every file node — emitting `threshold.file.<metric>`.
  Threshold values accept `_`
  separators and `K`/`M`/`G` suffixes via `config::parse_number` (CLI flags and a
  `deserialize_with` adaptor on `MetricThresholds` for quoted TOML strings); an
  invalid configuration is a hard error, never a silent fallback to defaults. Every `Violation` is identified
  by its dotted rule id (the config key / CLI flag, e.g. `threshold.file.loc`) and
  tagged with a concern group from the `config::RULES` catalog
  (`CYC`/`CPX`/`CPL`/`SIZ`; one entry per metric resolved by `rule_doc` — the
  trailing metric segment — with `rule_tuning` deriving the flag/config knob,
  documented in [ERRORS.md](ERRORS.md)). Prints diagnostics in the selected `--output-format`
  (`human` / `json` / `github` / `sarif`): `human` (`print_human_diagnostics`)
  renders each finding as a self-contained block (rule id, group, `where` = `id —
  path`, `issue`, `why`, `fix`, `tune`, `ref`) so it doubles as an AI prompt;
  the `ref` link and the `sarif` `helpUri` are absolute GitHub URLs (`DOCS_URL` →
  `…/blob/main/docs/ERRORS.md#group-<g>`) so they're clickable from anywhere.
  `sarif` describes the fired rules under `tool.driver.rules`. With
  `--suggest-config`, `human` output then calls `print_current_values` — the
  current per-kind cycle counts and the per-file metric maxima
  as paste-ready `code-split.toml` blocks for baselining (off by default;
  machine formats omit it). Honours `--top <N>` (report only the N worst) and exits
  non-zero on any violation; `--exit-zero` suppresses the non-zero exit. Writes no
  files.
- **`report`**: runs the shared analysis core (re-analyzing the workspace),
  then writes artifacts into `--report-path` (default `.code-split`) per
  `--format` (`json`, `html`; default both). The JSON snapshot records
  `config_file` when a config was found; default name
  `{project-dir}-{ts}.json` (`--json-name`). The HTML viewer template and all assets
  (CSS, JS) are embedded in the binary via `include_str!` from
  `crates/code-split-cli/src/assets/`, and the snapshot data is embedded
  inline in the same file as `cs-before` / `cs-after` JSON `<script>` tags;
  default name `{project-dir}-{ts}.html` (`--html-name`). With
  `--before <snapshot>` the HTML becomes a diff view (after = this run, before
  = the file) plus a verdict, named `{project-dir}-{ts}-diff.html` (`-diff`
  inserted before `.html`). `--before` accepts a `.json` snapshot or a prior
  `.html` report (the embedded snapshot is extracted via `load_snapshot_any`).
- **`diff`**: reads two **existing** snapshot files (`--before` / `--after`,
  no analysis), computes a structured diff via
  `code_split_core::compare_snapshots()`, and emits per `--format`
  (default `html`):
  - JSON diff (`--format json`, default name `diff.json`): `{ identical,
    before, after, files }` — the `files` graph has
    `{ nodes: { added, removed, affected, unchanged }, edges: { … },
    cycle_nodes_before, cycle_nodes_after, sccs_before, sccs_after }`, plus
    the `improved` / `degraded` / `neutral` verdict.
  - Interactive HTML viewer (`--format html`): all JS/CSS assets
    (`graphviz.umd.js`, `diff.js`, `layout.js`, etc.) are embedded via
    `include_str!` constants (`ASSET_GV`, `ASSET_DIFF`, …); the snapshots
    are also embedded **inline** as `<script type="application/json">` tags
    (`cs-before` / `cs-after`), which the viewer reads on load. The single
    `.html` file is fully self-contained — no relative-path references, no
    `fetch`, so it opens straight from `file://`.

**Responsibility boundary**: holds no domain logic; no analysis, no
rendering, no rules. Its sole job is argument parsing, plugin
dispatch, and artifact I/O routing.

#### HTML assets (`crates/code-split-cli/src/assets/`)

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-code-split-component-html-assets`

Static assets for the `code-split report` and `code-split diff` HTML output,
embedded into the `code-split` binary via `include_str!`. Files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.html` | Shell template with a single Files view section and the diff/review summary table. Header: `.header-brand` ("CODE SPLIT"), `#title` (`<target> — diff/review`), before/after metadata, and the `↑ change` / `↑ compare…` snapshot-swap buttons (`#btn-remove-after`). Nav: `[data-side]` Before/After buttons (diff mode only — hidden in review) and `#nav-prompt-btn` ("Prompt Generator AI", always visible). There is one graph level, so no level switcher. No control panel / status chips / review buttons — the UI is simplified so Before/After each render a clean single-snapshot diagram. |
| `index.css` | Layout, nav, SVG styling; cross-highlight: `.row-hl` (solid blue bg) and `g.node.node-hl` (blue drop-shadow) for hover; `.row-selected` (solid amber bg `rgb(254,245,222)`) and `g.node.node-selected > polygon/ellipse` (yellow fill + amber stroke) for persistent selection — hover rules last so they win; `body.mode-review` hides `#meta-arrow` and after-group metadata; `#node-modal` fills 100% width/height (fullscreen); `body.overflow:hidden` set on open, cleared on close. The popup main card uses `.mn-card` (`copy` cursor); on `.copied` the card body (`.mn-card-body`) is hidden and a centred `.mn-copied-msg` ("copied") is shown for ~1s. (Legacy chip / `hide-*` / `show-cycle-*` visibility rules remain in the file but are unused after the UI simplification.) |
| `graphviz.umd.js` | Graphviz compiled to WASM via `@hpcc-js/wasm` (~802 KB, self-contained, no network required); renders DOT→SVG in-browser |
| `diff.js` | Browser-side diff computation: `computeDiff()` (node/edge status), `computeCycles()` via `buildSCCOf()` helper — prefers backend `graph.cycles` array when present (accurate `CycleKind` classification); falls back to Tarjan SCC on edges when absent; marks nodes/edges as `before-only`/`after-only`/`both`/`none`; `computeMeta()` |
| `layout.js` | `buildDOT()` — for the single file graph: internal `file` nodes are blue (`fillcolor="#dbe9f4" color="#4d6f9c"`) and clustered by directory; `external` library nodes (when present) are amber with dashed amber edges. **At most one edge is emitted per `(from, to)` pair** — a file that both `use`s and `pub use`-reexports the same target draws a single arrow. Cycle-status class still added for CSS red-stroke overlay; `class="node-<kind> status-<status> cycle-status-<cs>"` on every node/edge |
| `modal.js` | `getModal()` returns (or lazily creates) the `#node-modal` overlay; `closeModal()` / `closeModalSilent()` hide it and restore `body.overflow`; fixed-position tooltip on `.nm-has-hint`; delegated click handlers for `.nm-copy-btn` (textContent ✓ feedback) and `.mn-card` (copies `data-copy`, adds a CSS `copied` class for ~1s — no textContent swap, since it is an SVG group) |
| `export-popup.js` | `openExportPopup()` — "Prompt Generator" popup. Top row: checkbox group (IDs / Paths / connections common / in / out) **OR** radio source selector (`Selected` = nodes checked in the node table; `Recommended` = top-N nodes sorted by HK then LOC, or by cycle membership for ADP preset) with numeric count input. Preset buttons map to named prompt templates (SOLID principles: ADP, SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP; DRY, KISS, LoD, MISU, CoI, YAGNI; plus Reduce Complexity, Split Components). Each preset auto-selects relevant checkboxes via `PRESET_CHECKS`. Named-principle prompts also append `Full principle: <url>` linking the full principle online (`principles/<lang>/<slug>.md` on GitHub via `PRINCIPLE_DOCS`/`principleUrl`; `lang` from the snapshot's `plugin`, JS→`typescript`). Textarea output = selected prompt text + node ids/paths/edge lists per active checkboxes. Fixed-size `Copy ⎘` button overlaid bottom-right of textarea. Popup is created once and re-used across opens. |
| `panzoom.js` | `setupPanZoom()` — viewBox-based drag-to-pan; +/−/fit/fullscreen buttons bottom-right (visible when mouse in right 15% of frame); size-mode buttons (■/LOC/HK) top-right re-render the active view; dblclick on SVG background zooms 2× at cursor; stores the fit-all viewBox on `frame.dataset.naturalVB` so `renderView` can preserve pan/zoom across re-renders; fullscreen overlay (`fs-bar`) hosts the live `<nav>` (the control panel was removed) |
| `ui.js` | Intentionally empty — before/after is now two separate clean diagrams (one graphviz layout per snapshot), so there is no chip-based filtering of a merged layout. Kept as a file because the report inlines its assets by name. |
| `app.js` | `DOMContentLoaded` handler. `window.viewSide` (`'before'`/`'after'`) selects which snapshot the diagram / node table / modal show; `activeLocalGraph()` returns that snapshot's file graph with external (3rd-party) nodes and their edges dropped from the main diagram entirely (externals appear only in the per-node modal, drawn in amber). `setViewSide()` (the Before/After buttons) re-renders the active view; `renderView()` runs `drawSVG`, re-applies the node-table selection, and — across Before/After **and** size-mode re-renders — preserves pan/zoom by carrying the *relative* zoom + fractional centre vs `frame.dataset.naturalVB` (so differing layout extents don't drift the framing). `updateHeader()` switches review/diff mode and shows/hides the Before/After buttons; `buildSummary()` is mode-aware. Reads inline `cs-before` / `cs-after` JSON via `readEmbeddedSnapshot`; `setupFileControls()` / `recomputeAll()` swap a `.json` snapshot or prior `.html` report from disk; `#nav-prompt-btn` → `openExportPopup()`. |
| `diagram.js` | `buildDiagramSVG(node)` — inline SVG popup diagram for a selected node. Edges are read from the raw snapshot (`window.AFTER ?? window.BEFORE`) so external library nodes (filtered from `window.DIFF`) are still visible. Outgoing/incoming edges are grouped by `kind` (`uses`, `reexports`) into proportionally-sized vertical columns; one arrow per column, labelled `fan_in: N` / `fan_out: N` (per-column count, only when > 0). The main node card shows `path` / `hk` / `loc` (no `id`); the **whole card is click-to-copy** (`.mn-card` + `data-copy`, pointer cursor) — clicking copies the path (the id for a library) and, for ~1s, hides the card body and shows a centred `copied` message. `External` library nodes (side cards and, when opened, the main card) are amber, show their full `ext:<name>` id, and carry no `loc`/`hk`. A `private` node gets a `[pr]` suffix (space-separated) after its name. Each side card has a `<title>` tooltip with the node's full path. The metric table spells out abbreviated keys via `NM_LABELS` (`hk` → "Henry-Kafura", `mi` → "Maintainability Index", `mi_sei` → "Maintainability Index (SEI)", `fan_in`/`fan_out` → "Fan-in"/"Fan-out") while tooltips still key off the short name. `MAX_ITEMS = 24` per column. |
| `nav.js` | `openModalForNode(nodeId)` — looks up node data first in `window.DIFF.files.nodes`, then falls back to the raw snapshot (`window.AFTER ?? window.BEFORE`) to support external library nodes that are excluded from the diff. |

**Affected status**: unchanged nodes/edges adjacent to changed (added/removed)
nodes or edges are promoted to `affected` status. Computed in `diff.js`
`computeDiff()` (browser-side), not in Rust.

**Cycle detection**: `computeCycles()` in `diff.js` runs Tarjan SCC on the
before and after adjacency lists of the file graph. Edges to external library
nodes are excluded from SCC construction (a leaf library cannot close a cycle).
Nodes/edges receive `cycle-status-{before-only|after-only|both|none}` class in
the DOT output, and the summary table reports cycle counts. (The chip-driven cycle
highlighting was removed with the control panel in the UI simplification; the
per-snapshot Before/After diagrams render each snapshot's own cycles inherently.)

**Offline guarantee**: no CDN references in any asset; `graphviz.umd.js`
embeds the WASM binary as a base91-encoded string and instantiates it from
an `ArrayBuffer` — works from `file://` with no network access.

### 3.3 API Contracts

Interfaces are defined in PRD §7. This section notes the implementation
binding.

#### Unified CLI (`cpt-code-split-interface-cli`)

- **Technology**: Rust binary with `clap`-derived subcommands
  (`check`, `report`, `diff`; no default command)
- **Location**: `crates/code-split-cli/src/main.rs`
- **Output**: `report` writes a snapshot `.json` to
  `{--report-path}/{project-dir}-{ts}.json` (default dir `.code-split`); name and
  directory tunable via `--json-name` / `--report-path`

#### Plugins (built-in, in-process)

Plugins are not external binaries. The three plugins — `rust`, `python`,
`javascript` — are compiled into the `code-split` binary and invoked
in-process; each writes its graphs directly into the shared `GraphBuilder`.
See [§3.7 Plugin System](#37-plugin-system).

#### Report Generator (`cpt-code-split-interface-report-cli`)

- **Technology**: built-in Rust renderer in `code-split-cli`
- **Location**: `crates/code-split-cli/src/main.rs` (`run_report`)
- **Template**: inline HTML string with all JS/CSS embedded

#### Diff Engine (`cpt-code-split-interface-diff-cli`)

- **Technology**: built-in Rust renderer in `code-split-cli`
- **Location**: `crates/code-split-cli/src/main.rs` (`run_diff`)

#### Graph JSON Schema (`cpt-code-split-interface-graph-schema`)

- **Location**: defined by `Snapshot`, `Node`, `Edge` structs in
  `crates/code-split-core/src/`
- **Versioning**: `schema_version: "1"`; additive fields are minor;
  breaking changes require a major-version bump

### 3.4 Internal Dependencies

| Consumer | Dependency | Interface |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| `code-split-cli` | `code-split-syn` | `analyze(workspace, &mut GraphBuilder)` |
| `code-split-cli` | `code-split-complexity` | `analyze(workspace, &mut GraphBuilder) -> Result<usize>` |
| `code-split-cli` | `code-split-core` | `GraphBuilder`, `compare_snapshots()`, `serde_json` serialization |
| `code-split-syn` | `code-split-core` | `GraphBuilder` write API |
| `code-split-complexity` | `code-split-core` | `GraphBuilder` read+write API, `Complexity` struct |
| `code-split-cli` (`run_report`) | snapshot `.json` | top-level metadata + `graphs` object |
| `code-split-cli` (`run_diff`) | two snapshot `.json` files | top-level metadata + `graphs` objects from both |
| `code-split-cli` (`run_compare`) | two snapshot `.json` files | `CompareSummary` JSON or self-contained HTML via `render_compare_html` |

**Rules**:

- No circular dependencies among the four Rust crates.
- Only `code-split-syn` may depend on `cargo_metadata` and `syn`.
- Only `code-split-complexity` may depend on `rust-code-analysis`.
- `code-split-core` has zero I/O and zero analyzer dependencies.
- The Rust plugin's module→file collapse lives in
  `code-split-cli/src/plugin/rust.rs`, downstream of `code-split-syn`.
- `code-split-cli` reads JSON artifacts from disk; no in-process coupling
  between the analysis crates and the report/diff rendering code.

### 3.5 External Dependencies

| Dependency | Interface | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| `cargo_metadata` crate | `MetadataCommand::exec()` | Enumerate workspace crates and path-dependencies |
| `syn` crate | `syn::parse_file`, `syn::visit::Visit` | Parse Rust source for module hierarchy and `use` statements |
| `rust-code-analysis` (fork: `ffedoroff/rust-code-analysis`, branch `patch/update-tree-sitter-0.26.8`) | `metrics(&parser, path) -> Option<FuncSpace>` | Tree-sitter-based multi-language complexity metrics |
| `petgraph` crate | `DiGraph` | Internal graph storage |
| `serde` + `serde_json` | derive macros, `to_writer_pretty` | JSON serialization |
| `clap` | derive macros | CLI argument parsing |
| Python stdlib | `json`, `pathlib`, `argparse` | JSON processing, file I/O, CLI parsing in Python tools |

### 3.6 Interactions & Sequences

#### Step 1 — Plugin Dispatch and Artifact Write

**ID**: `cpt-code-split-seq-extract`

    CLI -->> User: exit 0
```

#### Step 2 — Report Generation

**ID**: `cpt-code-split-seq-report`

`report` re-analyzes the workspace (the same plugin pipeline as Step 1) and
then writes artifacts.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Report as code-split report (built-in Rust)
    participant FS as Filesystem

    User ->> Report: code-split report . --format json,html
    Report ->> Report: run analysis pipeline (syn → complexity → module-to-file collapse, see Step 1)
    Report ->> Report: compute node weights (fan-in + fan-out)
    Report ->> FS: write {project-dir}-{ts}.json snapshot (when --format json)
    Report ->> Report: embed snapshot data inline as cs-before / cs-after JSON script tags
    Report ->> FS: write {project-dir}-{ts}.html (self-contained: assets + data embedded)
    Report -->> User: exit 0
```

#### Step 4 — Diff

**ID**: `cpt-code-split-seq-diff`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Diff as code-split diff (built-in Rust)
    participant FS as Filesystem

    User ->> Diff: code-split diff --before before.json --after after.json
    Diff ->> FS: read both snapshot files
    Diff ->> Diff: validate schema version compatibility
    Diff ->> Diff: compute GraphDiff on the files graph (added/removed nodes & edges, weight delta)
    Diff ->> Diff: promote unchanged nodes/edges adjacent to changes → affected status
    Diff ->> Diff: determine coupling direction verdict (improved / degraded / neutral)
    Diff ->> Diff: embed both snapshots inline as cs-before / cs-after JSON script tags
    Diff ->> FS: write index.html (self-contained: all assets + data embedded from binary) [--format html, default]
    Diff ->> FS: write diff.json (machine-readable diff + verdict) [--format json]
    Diff -->> User: exit 0
```

### 3.7 Plugin System

#### Plugin Resolution

All plugins are built into the `code-split` binary; there is no external
or dynamic plugin loading. Resolution only selects which built-in plugin
to run.

The plugin defaults to `auto`. When `--plugin auto`, the analysis core
(behind `check` / `report`) resolves the plugin *name* in this order,
stopping at the first match:

```
1. Explicit flag    --plugin <name> (≠ auto) on the command line
                    → use that built-in plugin

2. Config           the `plugin` key in code-split.toml /
                    Cargo.toml metadata (if set and ≠ auto)
                    → use that built-in plugin

3. Auto-detect      project markers in the workspace root:
                    Cargo.toml → rust;
                    pyproject.toml / setup.py / setup.cfg → python;
                    package.json / tsconfig.json → javascript
```

The resolved name must be one of the three compiled-in plugins — `rust`,
`python`, or `javascript` (JS+TS) — which is then invoked in-process.
Multiple matching markers or none → error asking for an explicit
`--plugin`.

#### Snapshot File Format

`code-split report` writes the snapshot into `--report-path` (default
`.code-split` in the current working directory) with a slug-and-timestamp
name (`--json-name`, default `{project-dir}-{ts}.json`):

```
.code-split/{project-dir}-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.json
```

Example: `code-split report /path/to/axum-api --plugin rust --format json`
(run from `~/projects/code-split`) →
`~/projects/code-split/.code-split/axum-api-20260522-112233.json`

The file combines metadata and the single `files` graph in one document:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "generated_at":   "2026-05-22T11:22:33Z",
  "command":        "code-split report /path/to/axum-api --plugin rust --format json",
  "workspace":      "/Users/alice/projects/code-split",
  "target":         "/Users/alice/projects/axum-api",
  "plugin":         "rust",
  "local_only":     false,
  "versions": {
    "code-split": "0.3.1",
    "plugin_rust": "0.3.1",
    "rustc": "1.78.0"
  },
  "roots": {
    "cargo":    "/Users/alice/.cargo",
    "registry": "/Users/alice/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-abc123",
    "rustup":   "/Users/alice/.rustup",
    "rust-src": "/Users/alice/.rustup/toolchains/stable-aarch64-apple-darwin/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library"
  },
  "git": {
    "branch": "refactor/split-handlers",
    "commit": "a3f9c21",
    "dirty_files": 4
  },
  "graphs": {
    "files": { "nodes": [...], "edges": [...] }
  }
}
```

`workspace` is the directory where `code-split` was invoked (cwd). `target`
is the analyzed project path. `roots` are named prefixes for path
resolution: `roots[name] + "/" + rest` → absolute path. All node `path`
values and `file:` IDs use `{name}/…` notation referencing these roots.

The Rust plugin populates roots automatically via `detect_roots()`:

| Root | Source | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| `target` | analyzed project path | `/path/to/my-crate` |
| `cargo` | `$CARGO_HOME` or `~/.cargo` | `/Users/alice/.cargo` |
| `registry` | first `index.crates.io-*` dir under cargo | `.../registry/src/index.crates.io-abc123` |
| `rustup` | `$RUSTUP_HOME` or `~/.rustup` | `/Users/alice/.rustup` |
| `rust-src` | `rustc --print sysroot` + `/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library` | `.../toolchains/stable-aarch64-apple-darwin/.../library` |

`rust-src` is only added when the path exists on disk; omitted otherwise.
It shortens stdlib paths like `{rustup}/toolchains/stable-aarch64-apple-darwin/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/alloc/src/vec/mod.rs`
to `{rust-src}/alloc/src/vec/mod.rs`.

**Assembly**: the built-in plugin produces the `graphs` object in-process
(written into the shared `GraphBuilder`). `code-split` then runs
`relativize_graphs` + `rewrite_ids`, prepends all metadata fields, and
writes the final snapshot file.

`rewrite_ids` rewrites node `id` and edge `from`/`to` fields, applying
path relativization so an absolute `file:/abs/path` becomes
`file:{root}/…` using the named roots.

`versions.plugin_<name>` is the built-in plugin's version, which equals
the `code-split` binary's own version (all plugins ship inside it).

The `git` fields are collected by `code-split` before invoking the plugin:

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| `branch` | `git -C <workspace> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` |
| `commit` | `git -C <workspace> rev-parse --short HEAD` |
| `dirty_files` | `git -C <workspace> status --porcelain \| wc -l` |

If any call fails the `git` key is omitted entirely — no error is raised.

`code-split report` (from the snapshot it just produced) and `code-split diff`
(from the two snapshot files it reads) embed this metadata in the generated
HTML as a visible "Snapshot info" panel.

#### Built-in Plugin: Rust

At P1 the only built-in plugin is `rust`. It is compiled directly into
the `code-split` binary and invoked in-process, so no sub-process overhead
is incurred. Its internal structure is the `code-split-syn` crate plus a
module→file collapse pass in `code-split-cli/src/plugin/rust.rs`; it is
not a separate binary on disk. There is no rust-analyzer dependency, so
the run completes in seconds.

##### Analysis Modes and Prerequisites

The Rust plugin has two modes selected by flags on the analyzing commands
(`code-split check` / `code-split report`):

| Mode | Flag | `cargo` required | Network / registry | External nodes |
|------|------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| Full | *(none)* | yes | yes (or cached) | yes |
| Local-only | `--local-only` | yes | no | not enumerated |

The project does NOT need to compile in any mode — `syn` parses source
syntactically and tolerates errors. Only dependency resolution
(`cargo metadata`) is required for full mode.

##### Full Mode — Step-by-Step

```
code-split report /path/to/my-crate --plugin rust
```

1. `code-split-cli` creates the output directory (`--report-path`, default
   `.code-split/`).
2. Collects git state (`branch`, `commit`, `dirty_files`) from
   `/path/to/my-crate`.
3. Invokes `code-split-syn::analyze`:
   a. Runs `cargo metadata --format-version=1` inside the workspace.
   b. Identifies all local packages (those with a `path` source).
   c. For each local package, locates the crate root (`lib.rs` /
      `main.rs` / `[lib] path`).
   d. Recursively follows `mod foo;` declarations using `syn`, building
      the module tree and collecting all `use` / `pub use` statements.
   e. Emits `Crate`, `Module`, `Trait` nodes and `Contains`, `Uses`,
      `Reexports` edges into `GraphBuilder`.
   f. External crates are added as opaque `Crate` nodes with
      `external = true`; their source is never read.
4. Invokes `code-split-complexity::analyze`:
   a. Walks all `.rs` files in the workspace with `walkdir`.
   b. For each file, parses it with `rust-code-analysis` to obtain a
      `FuncSpace` tree.
   c. Annotates each file-backed `Module` node with whole-file metrics
      from the root space (matched by canonical path).
5. Collapses the module graph to a **file graph** (in `plugin/rust.rs`):
   a. Every `.rs` file becomes one `File` node (`file:<path>`); inline
      `mod {}` modules fold into their containing file.
   b. `Uses` / `Reexports` edges are re-pointed from module ids to the
      file ids that own them, so file→file connections are preserved.
      Cross-file `Contains` edges (a `mod foo;` declaration of a separate
      file) are re-emitted as `Uses` (`lib.rs → foo.rs`) so module-declared
      files get `fan_in`; same-file `Contains` (inline modules) collapses
      to a self-edge and is dropped.
   c. External crates collapse to `External` library nodes (`ext:<name>`)
      at depth 1; edges into them are flagged `external: true`.
   d. A **local** workspace crate maps to its crate-root file (`lib.rs` /
      `main.rs`), so a cross-crate `use other_crate::…` (or captured
      bare-path reference) becomes a file→file edge to that crate's root.
      Crate→crate dependency edges (from `cargo metadata`) are dropped as
      crate-level meta.
6. Runs `annotate_all_cycles` (SCC → `CycleKind`) and `annotate_hk`
   (internal `fan_in`/`fan_out`/`hk`; `fan_out_external` separately) on
   the file graph, then `annotate_stats`.
7. Writes the final snapshot `.json` (metadata + `timings` + `files` graph).

##### Local-Only Mode — Step-by-Step

```
code-split report /path/to/my-crate --plugin rust --local-only
```

Steps are identical to full mode except `cargo metadata` is called with
`--no-deps`, so external packages are not enumerated and
`metadata.resolve` is `None`. The file graph and per-file complexity are
still produced; there are simply fewer (or no) `External` library nodes.

Use this mode when dependencies are unreachable or you only need the
internal file graph.

##### Failure Modes

| Situation | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `cargo` not on `$PATH` | exit 1 — "cargo not found" (the Rust plugin requires `cargo` for `cargo metadata`) |
| `cargo metadata` fails (dependency resolution error) | exit 1 — cargo stderr forwarded verbatim + hint to try `--local-only` |
| Workspace member glob matches no directories | warning logged; zero crates emitted for that glob |
| A source file has a syntax error | `syn` parse failure logged as a warning; file is skipped; analysis continues |
| Output directory not writable | exit 1 before analysis starts |

#### P3 Framework-Specific Plugins

Framework plugins (Django, WordPress, etc.) MAY emit additional metadata
beyond the base schema vocabulary by using the `metadata` object on nodes
and edges. The `kind` field MUST remain one of the base kinds (`file`,
`external`) so base consumers can still process the graph.
Framework-specific semantics are expressed in `metadata.<plugin>.*` keys
and are ignored by base consumers.

Example — a Django-specific annotation on a file node:

```json
{
  "id": "file:{target}/myapp/signals.py",
  "kind": "file",
  "name": "signals.py",
  "path": "{target}/myapp/signals.py",
  "metadata": {
    "django": {
      "signal": "post_save",
      "sender": "User"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.8 CLI Examples

#### Snapshots — `code-split report --format json`

`code-split report` always re-analyzes the project and writes the snapshot
to `--report-path` (default `.code-split/`) under the `--json-name` template
(default `{project-dir}-{ts}.json`, e.g. `.code-split/my-lib-20260522-112233.json`).

**Rust (built-in)**

```bash
# 1. Default snapshot: .code-split/my-crate-20260522-112233.json
code-split report . --plugin rust --format json

# 2. Explicit file name — for a named state
code-split report . --plugin rust --format json --json-name before-refactor.json

# 3. Local-only mode — file graph without external dependency resolution
code-split report . --plugin rust --local-only --format json
# → .code-split/my-crate-20260522-114500.json, "local_only": true
```

**Python (built-in)**

```bash
# 1. Default dated snapshot
code-split report ~/projects/my-lib --plugin python --format json

# 2. Explicit name for a named state
code-split report . --plugin python --format json --json-name v2.4.0.json

# 3. Pass the root package via plugin-args
code-split report . --plugin python --format json -- --root-package src/myapp
# → .code-split/my-lib-20260522-120000.json
```

**JavaScript / TypeScript (built-in)**

```bash
# 1. Default dated snapshot
code-split report ~/projects/frontend --plugin javascript --format json

# 2. Explicit tsconfig via plugin-args
code-split report . --plugin javascript --format json -- --tsconfig ./packages/core/tsconfig.json

# 3. Only src/, ignore node_modules and dist
code-split report . --plugin javascript --format json \
    --json-name src-only.json \
    --ignore node_modules --ignore dist -- --root src
```

---

#### Visualization — `code-split report`

`report` always re-analyzes the project and writes the snapshot `.json` **and** the
HTML viewer together.

```bash
# 1. Snapshot + report side by side, in .code-split/ (default format json,html)
code-split report . --plugin rust
open .code-split/my-crate-20260522-112233.html   # default {project-dir}-{ts}.html

# 2. Report in docs/ for sharing with the team
code-split report . --plugin rust \
    --report-path docs --html-name coupling.html

# 3. CI: analyze the project → artifacts into the CI folder
code-split report . --plugin rust \
    --report-path /artifacts/code-split --html-name report-pr-1234.html
```

---

#### Diff — `code-split diff`

`diff` compares two existing snapshots (no analysis). The default is
`--format html` (`index.html`); `--format json` writes a machine-readable
`diff.json` with a verdict for CI.

```bash
# 1. Before and after a refactor — HTML viewer
code-split diff \
    --before .code-split/app-20260520-093000.json \
    --after  .code-split/app-20260522-112233.json \
    --html-name diff-20260522.html

# 2. Named snapshots
code-split diff \
    --before .code-split/before-refactor.json \
    --after  .code-split/after-refactor.json \
    --html-name diff-refactor.html

# 3. CI: main vs PR, JSON verdict for a PR comment
code-split diff \
    --before /artifacts/code-split/main.json \
    --after  /artifacts/code-split/pr-1234.json \
    --report-path /artifacts/code-split --format json
cat /artifacts/code-split/diff.json | jq '.verdict'
```

---

#### Full end-to-end workflow

```bash
# Steps 1+2: snapshot before the refactor + report (report does both)
code-split report . --plugin rust --json-name before.json
open .code-split/my-crate-20260522-112233.html   # {project-dir}-{ts}.html, inspect the heavy nodes

# -- Step 3: the user makes changes (by hand or with an AI) --

# Steps 1+2 again: snapshot after the changes + report
code-split report . --plugin rust --json-name after.json

# Step 4: diff the two snapshots
code-split diff \
    --before .code-split/before.json \
    --after  .code-split/after.json \
    --html-name diff.html
open .code-split/diff.html

# Alternative: report + compare against a baseline in one run (--before)
code-split report . --plugin rust --before .code-split/before.json
open .code-split/my-crate-20260522-112233-diff.html   # --before names it -diff.html; already a diff view + verdict
```

**Out of scope for this revision (deferred to P2/P3)**:

- Recommender rules catalog and `Finding` types (removed from P1)
- LLM prompt generation (P2 for AI prompts, P3 for principles prompts)
- CI artifact integration (P2)
- Additional language plugins (P3)

**Module→file collapse trade-off**: Rust dependencies are expressed via
module paths (`use crate::foo::bar`), not file paths. Rather than emit a
separate module graph, the Rust plugin builds the module tree and then
collapses it to files — folding inline `mod {}` modules into their file
and re-pointing `use`/`pub use` edges to files — so file→file
connections are fully preserved in the single graph model. There is no
function-level call graph: resolving call sites semantically would
require rust-analyzer (slow, volatile), which has been removed.

**HTML asset bundling**: All JS/CSS assets for `code-split report` and
`code-split diff` are embedded into the binary via `include_str!`. The
Graphviz WASM bundle is committed under
`crates/code-split-cli/src/assets/` and never fetched at runtime.
Generated HTML files work offline via `file://` with no network access.

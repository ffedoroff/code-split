# code-split

Structural-analysis tool for **Rust, Python, JavaScript and TypeScript** codebases. Built **AI-agent-friendly first** — finds where a project has structural problems and hands an actionable shortlist to a human or an AI agent for the actual refactor.

**Status:** pre-alpha. APIs and output shapes may change without notice. Pin a specific version.

## What it finds

- **Components that grew too complex and should be split.** Per-function and per-module cyclomatic / cognitive / Halstead / MI metrics; flags entities above your threshold.
- **Strong coupling between components.** Computes fan-in / fan-out / HK on the call and module graphs; surfaces the modules that everything depends on (or that depend on everything).
- **Cyclic dependencies.** Detects SCCs at module, file and function level — including the silent ones the compiler does not catch.
- **Files that are just too big.** Raw LOC, public surface size, item / method counts per file.

The tool **does not refactor for you**. It produces a structured, machine-readable list of problem spots and an offline HTML report a human or an LLM can act on.

## CI integration

Runs as a linter. Configure thresholds in `code-split.toml`; the CLI exits non-zero when the codebase breaches them — so a PR that introduces a new cycle, a function above your cognitive budget, or a file above your LOC limit fails the build.

```sh
code-split analyze --plugin rust . && \
  code-split lint --max-cycles 0 --max-cognitive 25 --max-loc 800
```

## Full CLI

Written in Rust — fast, memory-safe, single static-ish binary with **no runtime dependencies** (no Python, no Node, no JVM, no shared libs to install). One file on PATH, done.

Everything is driven from the command line: `analyze` → snapshot JSON, `report` → offline HTML, `diff` → before/after report between two snapshots, `lint` → CI gate. No daemon, no language server, no plugin host required at runtime.

## HTML report with dynamic diagrams

`code-split report` writes a single self-contained HTML file with:

- Three interactive levels: modules, files, functions.
- Dagre-laid-out graph with pan/zoom and live filtering.
- Sortable tables per metric; click a node to open its neighbourhood.
- "Prompt generator" panel that copies a ready-to-paste prompt (one for each principle: ADP, SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP, DRY, KISS, LoD, MISU, CoI, YAGNI; plus *Reduce Complexity*, *Split Components*) — feed the prompt + the selected nodes to your AI agent.

No network, no analytics, no telemetry. Open in any browser, share as a file.

## Install

Pick a channel:

```sh
# universal — shell installer that drops the prebuilt binary on PATH
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ffedoroff/code-split/releases/latest/download/code-split-installer.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://github.com/ffedoroff/code-split/releases/latest/download/code-split-installer.ps1 | iex"

# Rust (Cargo)
cargo install code-split --version 0.1.0-alpha.9

# Node (npm)
npm install -g code-split

# Python (pip / uv / pipx)
pip install code-split

# Docker (Docker Hub)
docker pull ffedoroff/code-split:0.1.0-alpha.9

# Docker (GHCR — no anonymous rate limits)
docker pull ghcr.io/ffedoroff/code-split:0.1.0-alpha.9
```

All channels ship the same `code-split` binary built from the same Rust source. Linux (x86_64, aarch64), macOS (x86_64, aarch64), Windows (x86_64).

## Quick start

```sh
# extract dependency graphs from a workspace
code-split analyze --plugin rust ./path/to/project
# → modules.json / files.json / functions.json

# generate an offline interactive HTML report
code-split report ./snapshots/latest

# before / after refactor comparison
code-split diff ./snapshots/before ./snapshots/after
```

Built-in plugins: `rust` (cargo + syn + rust-analyzer), `python`, `javascript` (also handles TypeScript). Third-party plugins resolved as `code-split-plugin-<name>` on PATH.

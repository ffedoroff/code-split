//! Rust sample fixture for code-ranker.
//!
//! Goal: exercise every file→file dependency form the analyzer DOES detect,
//! plus the known blind spots it does NOT (yet) detect. The analyzer is
//! `syn`-based: it walks `Item::Use` and `Item::Mod`, and also collects
//! bare qualified paths (`foo::run()`, `crate::a::Alpha`) from expressions and
//! types. Macros are never expanded.

// `mod foo;` (file-backed module) — each becomes a File node. The declaration
// itself is emitted as a `Contains` edge (lib.rs → child): kept in the JSON
// snapshot as structural ownership, but NOT drawn on the main map and NOT
// counted in fan_in / HK / cycles. It is metadata, not information flow.

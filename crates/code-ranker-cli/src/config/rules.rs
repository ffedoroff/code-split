        why: "Two units import each other (A ↔ B), so neither can be built, tested, or \
              understood in isolation — the tightest possible coupling.",
        fix: "Move the shared types into a third, lower-level unit both depend on; invert one \
              direction behind a trait/interface; or merge the two if they are really one concept.",

        title: "Chain dependency cycle",
        why: "Three or more units form a strongly-connected component (A → B → C → A); the whole \
              component must be loaded and changed together, defeating modular boundaries.",
        fix: "Find the edge that closes the loop — usually one 'back' dependency pointing upward — \
              and invert or remove it, or introduce an abstraction layer between the units.",

        title: "Cyclomatic complexity",
        why: "Cyclomatic complexity counts the independent paths through a unit; high values mean \
              many branches, which demand many tests and are easy to get wrong. A high graph \
              average means branching is spread across the codebase, not just one hotspot.",
        fix: "Split the function, replace branching with polymorphism or a lookup table, and pull \
              guard clauses to the top to flatten nesting. For an average breach, simplify the \
              worst offenders first (--top).",

              finds it to follow; a high score reads as 'hard to hold in your head'. A high average \
              means readability is degrading broadly.",
        fix: "Extract nested blocks into named helpers, use early returns to cut nesting depth, and \
              avoid mixing several control structures in one function. For an average breach, target \
              the worst nodes first (--top).",

        why: "Henry-Kafura — sloc × (fan_in × fan_out)² — flags units that are both highly connected \
              and large: change-amplifiers whose edits ripple widely across the system.",
        fix: "Cut fan-in or fan-out: narrow the public surface, split the unit by responsibility, or \
              route dependencies through a smaller interface. Shrinking the file (sloc) also lowers hk.",

        title: "Fan-in",
        why: "Many other units depend on this one, making it risky to change and a single point of \
              failure — though some hubs (shared types) carry high fan-in legitimately.",
        fix: "If the fan-in is unintended, split the unit so each caller depends only on the slice \
              it uses; otherwise stabilize the interface so high fan-in is safe.",

        title: "Fan-out",

              test in isolation.",
        fix: "Group related dependencies behind a facade, inject collaborators instead of reaching \
              for them, or move logic closer to the data it uses to cut outgoing edges.",

        key: "loc",
        group: "SIZ",
        title: "Source size",

              responsibilities and are harder to review, test, and reuse.",
        fix: "Split by responsibility into smaller units, extract helpers, and separate data \
              definitions from behavior. For an average breach, break up the largest units first (--top).",

//! Configuration: data model, loading, graph filtering, rule catalog, and rule
//! evaluation — one submodule per concern. This module re-exports the surface the
//! CLI consumes as `config::…`. Unlike the foundational crates this is a safe
//! place for a re-export facade: its fan-in is small, so the squared-coupling HK
//! term stays negligible.
